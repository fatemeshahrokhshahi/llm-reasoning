      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and the consequent affirmation is \"Amy played tennis\". \n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"Jeff played basketball\" and q is \"Amy played tennis\". We are also given q, which is \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are looking at the logical structure of the argument to see if it entails p (\"Jeff played basketball\").\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case. Given that we have q (\"Amy played tennis\"), we are examining if this affirmation allows us to conclude p (\"Jeff played basketball\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional, it's clear that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, Amy played tennis, but it does not guarantee the reverse. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis. The directional nature of the conditional and the possibility of alternative causes for Amy playing tennis must be considered.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. The presence of \"Amy played tennis\" does not logically imply \"Jeff played basketball\" because the conditional only works in one direction and there could be multiple reasons for Amy playing tennis.\n\nAnswer: no"
