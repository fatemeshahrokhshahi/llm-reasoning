The conditional statement is p → q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement, we have (p → q) ∧ q, and we are trying to determine if this implies p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - According to the question, we are testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this scenario.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that the presence of the unicorn in the forest could be caused by multiple factors, not just the presence of the griffin. The conditional statement only guarantees that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn will be too, but it does not rule out other causes for the unicorn's presence.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we conclude that affirming the consequent is not valid in this case. The presence of the unicorn in the forest does not necessarily imply the presence of the griffin.\n\nAnswer: no"
