      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and the consequent affirmation is \"The pants were denim\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"the shirt was cotton\" and q is \"the pants were denim\". The affirmation of the consequent q is given as \"The pants were denim\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the shirt being cotton implies the pants being denim, and we know the pants were indeed denim.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent q (\"The pants were denim\") is valid to infer p (\"The shirt was cotton\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically, we must remember the directional nature of conditionals. The statement only implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, but it does not imply the reverse. There could be other reasons why the pants are denim (other fabrics of the shirt could also be paired with denim pants).\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the critical rule that affirming the consequent is invalid, we cannot logically infer that the shirt was cotton simply because the pants were denim. The original conditional statement does not preclude other possibilities for the shirt's material when the pants are denim.\n\nAnswer: no"
