      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" (p → q), where p is \"Ben ate pasta\" and q is \"Kate ate the salad\". The consequent affirmation is \"Kate ate the salad\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" and the consequence \"Kate ate the salad\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement, we see that it follows the form (p → q) ∧ q, where p is \"Ben ate pasta\" and q is \"Kate ate the salad\". \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent \"Kate ate the salad\" is valid to infer \"Ben ate pasta\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - It is critical to examine the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes. The statement only guarantees that if Ben ate pasta, Kate ate the salad, but it does not guarantee that Kate eating the salad is a result of Ben eating pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate the salad.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. We cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta solely because Kate ate the salad.\n\nAnswer: no"
