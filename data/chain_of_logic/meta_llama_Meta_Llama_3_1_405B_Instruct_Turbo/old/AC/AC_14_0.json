The conditional statement is p → q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement, we have (p → q) ∧ q, and we are trying to determine if this implies p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - According to the question, we are testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this scenario.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that the statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" only guarantees that if the bear is in the cave, the wolf will be in the den. However, it does not guarantee that the bear is in the cave if the wolf is in the den. There could be alternative causes for the wolf being in the den.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, affirming the consequent in this scenario is invalid. The presence of the wolf in the den does not necessarily imply that the bear is in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no"
