      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and the consequent affirmation is \"The book is a mystery novel\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"the book was written by James\" and q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". The affirmation of the consequent q is given as \"The book is a mystery novel\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q to see if it logically entails p. According to the critical rule, affirming the consequent is generally considered invalid in logical deductions.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this context. Given that there could be multiple causes (authors) leading to the same effect (a mystery novel), we cannot assume a single cause (James being the author) solely based on the effect (the book being a mystery novel).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals and considering alternative causes. The statement only guarantees that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel, but it does not preclude other authors from writing mystery novels.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, affirming the consequent in this case does not logically entail the original condition. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the book was written by James solely because it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no"
