      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and the consequent affirmation is \"The truck was blue\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"the car was red\" and q is \"the truck was blue\". The affirmation of the consequent is q, which is \"The truck was blue\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the car being red implies the truck being blue, and we know the truck is indeed blue.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent (\"The truck was blue\") is valid to infer the antecedent (\"The car was red\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - This is the critical step. We must remember that conditionals work in one direction only. Just because the truck being blue is a consequence of the car being red, it does not mean that the car being red is the only reason for the truck to be blue. There could be other reasons why the truck is blue.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes for the truck being blue, affirming the consequent in this case does not logically infer that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no"
