      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and the consequent affirmation is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"Joe went to the park\" and q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\". The affirmation of the consequent q is given as \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the combination of the conditional statement and the affirmation of its consequent logically leads to p (\"Joe went to the park\").\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this context. However, according to the critical rule, affirming the consequent is generally considered invalid in logical deductions.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional provided, it's clear that the statement only guarantees that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, but it does not guarantee the reverse. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we conclude that affirming the consequent in this case does not logically imply that Joe went to the park. The conditional statement works in one direction, and affirming the consequent is a logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
