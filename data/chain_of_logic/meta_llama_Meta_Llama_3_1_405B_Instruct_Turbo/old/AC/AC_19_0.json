      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and the consequent affirmation is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) gives us p = \"Tom watched football\" and q = \"Jen watched basketball\". The affirmation of the consequent is q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the affirmation of the consequent logically leads to the affirmation of the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case means checking if Jen watching basketball necessarily means Tom watched football.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes, we must remember that conditionals work in one direction only. There could be multiple reasons why Jen watched basketball, not just because Tom watched football.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the critical rule that affirming the consequent is invalid, we conclude that from \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Jen watched basketball\", we cannot logically infer \"Tom watched football\".\n\nAnswer: no"
