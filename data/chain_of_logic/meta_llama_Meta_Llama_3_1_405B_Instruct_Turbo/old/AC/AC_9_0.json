      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and the consequent affirmation is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". We also have the affirmation of q, which is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we need to determine if this logically implies p. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case means checking if Mark buying the blue shirt necessarily means Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional, we see that the original statement only guarantees that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, but it does not guarantee the reverse. There could be other reasons Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the one-directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes for Mark buying the blue shirt, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
