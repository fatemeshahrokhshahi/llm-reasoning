      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and the consequent affirmation is \"The banana was yellow\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"the apple was red\" and q is \"the banana was yellow\". We also have the affirmation of q, which is \"The banana was yellow\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the affirmation of q (\"The banana was yellow\") can logically lead us to p (\"the apple was red\").\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this scenario. Given that we have \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow\", we are checking if we can infer \"The apple was red\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes. The statement only guarantees that if the apple was red, the banana would be yellow, but it does not preclude other reasons for the banana being yellow. There could be multiple causes for the banana being yellow, not just the apple being red.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. The presence of a yellow banana does not necessarily imply that the apple was red because conditionals work in one direction only, and there could be other reasons for the banana's color.\n\nAnswer: no"
