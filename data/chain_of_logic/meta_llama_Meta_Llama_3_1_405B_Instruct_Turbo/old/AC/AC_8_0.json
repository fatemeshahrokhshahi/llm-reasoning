      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and the consequent affirmation is \"The mummy was awake\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"the vampire was awake\" and q is \"the mummy was awake\". The affirmation of the consequent q is given as \"The mummy was awake\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the vampire being awake leading to the mummy being awake, combined with the mummy indeed being awake, logically leads to the vampire being awake.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this context. The question asks if we can infer the vampire was awake from the given statements.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional, it's clear that the statement only implies that the vampire's wakefulness guarantees the mummy's wakefulness, but not the reverse. There could be alternative reasons for the mummy being awake.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. The presence of the mummy being awake does not necessarily imply the vampire was awake due to the directional nature of the conditional and the possibility of alternative causes for the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: no"
