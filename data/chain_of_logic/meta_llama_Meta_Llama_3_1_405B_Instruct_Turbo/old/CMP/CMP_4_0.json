  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - Identify the nested conditional structure and probability claims: \nThe given information is that it's likely Priya will get the offer (p), and if Julian doesn't get the offer (q), then if Priya doesn't (p), Diego will (r). The nested conditional structure is p → (q → r) but adjusted for the scenario: p → (¬q → (¬p → r)).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Break down into elements: probabilities, nested conditionals, and the question: \n- It's likely Priya will get the offer (p is likely).\n- If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will (¬q → (¬p → r)).\n- The question is whether it follows that it is likely that, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will (¬p → r).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyze: If p → (¬q → (¬p → r)) and p is likely, does ¬p → r become likely?\nIn pure logic, if p → (¬q → (¬p → r)) and p, then ¬q → (¬p → r). However, with probabilities, the inference may not hold.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Check if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals:\nGiven p's likelihood, we cannot directly infer the likelihood of ¬p → r because the conditional involves low-probability outcomes, specifically Diego being a longshot.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - CRITICAL: Analyze probability distribution in the conditional scenario:\nThe scenario's probability distribution is critical. Since Diego is a longshot, even if Priya doesn't get the offer, it doesn't necessarily make it likely that Diego will. Julian's chances still need to be considered, and the conditionality doesn't directly transfer likelihood to Diego.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid:\nGiven the analysis, the Complex Modus Ponens inference is invalid in this probabilistic context. The likelihood of Priya getting the offer does not directly transfer to make it likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will.\n\nAnswer: no"
