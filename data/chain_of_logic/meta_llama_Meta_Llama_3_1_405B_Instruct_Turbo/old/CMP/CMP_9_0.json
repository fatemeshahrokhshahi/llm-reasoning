  "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The given information can be broken down into the following nested conditional structure and probability claims:\n- It's likely apples will be the top-selling fruit.\n- If bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be.\n- It's likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the elements:\n- Probabilities: Apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit, bananas are less likely but still more likely than oranges.\n- Nested conditionals: If bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be.\n- Question: Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given information:\nIf (bananas aren’t the top seller) → (if apples aren’t the top seller → oranges will be), and it's likely apples will be the top seller (making bananas not the top seller likely as well), does it make (if apples aren’t the top seller → oranges will be) likely?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals:\nGiven the initial probabilities, we might be tempted to say yes. However, we need to consider the actual probability distribution.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario:\nSince apples are likely to be the top seller and bananas are the close second, the scenario where apples aren’t the top seller is less likely, and within that scenario, oranges being the top seller is even less likely because bananas are more likely to take the top spot than oranges.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid:\nGiven the probability distribution, the inference breaks down. The nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem, making the Complex Modus Ponens inference invalid in this probabilistic context.\n\nAnswer: no"
