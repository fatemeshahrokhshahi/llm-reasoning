  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",
  "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step using this logical reasoning method and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.\n\nUse this 6-step reasoning process:\n\nStep 1: Structured Input - Identify the nested conditional structure and probability claims\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Break down into elements: probabilities, nested conditionals, and the question\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyze: If p → (q → r) and p is likely, does q → r become likely?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Check if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - CRITICAL: Analyze probability distribution in the conditional scenario\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid\n\nCRITICAL RULE: COMPLEX MODUS PONENS WITH PROBABILITIES IS OFTEN INVALID\n- While p → (q → r), p ⊢ q → r works in pure logic, it FAILS with probability/likelihood\n- When p is likely but q → r involves low-probability outcomes, the inference breaks down\n- The nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem\n- This is McGee's counterexample to modus ponens in probabilistic contexts\n\nNow apply this reasoning to the following question:",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a nested conditional structure: If Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyonce's will. We also have probability claims: it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the elements, we have probabilities (Taylor Swift's album selling the most, Bad Bunny's not selling the most), nested conditionals (if Bad Bunny's doesn't sell the most, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyonce's will), and the question (is it likely that if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the structure, we see that if Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyonce's will. Given that Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most, we need to check if the likelihood transfers through the nested conditionals.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if the likelihood of Taylor Swift's album selling the most copies makes it likely that if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - This is where the critical analysis of probability distribution comes in. Even though Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most copies, the scenario where Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies creates a different probability distribution. In this scenario, it's more likely that Bad Bunny's album sells the most copies, not Beyonce's, since Beyonce's album is projected to be far behind.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the probability distribution problem in the conditional scenario, the Complex Modus Ponens inference is invalid. The likelihood of Taylor Swift's album selling the most copies does not transfer to make it likely that if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.\n\nAnswer: no"
