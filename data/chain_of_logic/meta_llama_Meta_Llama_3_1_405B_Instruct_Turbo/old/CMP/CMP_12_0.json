  "user_prompt": "Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren’t #1, then if thrillers aren’t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be?",
