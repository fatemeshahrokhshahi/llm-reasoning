The original statement is ♢p ∨ ♢q, and the proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression ♢p ∨ ♢q ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q, we need to consider if the disjunctive possibility implies the conjunctive possibility.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we must examine the context and the semantics of the modal operators.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we find that standard modal logic does not support the implication of ♢p ∧ ♢q from ♢p ∨ ♢q. The wide-scope free choice inference is a debated topic in semantics.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the controversy surrounding wide-scope free choice and the difference in truth conditions between disjunctive and conjunctive possibilities, we cannot conclude that the proposed inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
