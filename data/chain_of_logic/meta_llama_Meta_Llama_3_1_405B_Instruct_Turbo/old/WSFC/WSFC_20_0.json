The original statement is ♢p ∨ ♢q, and the proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression ♢p ∨ ♢q ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q, we need to consider if the disjunctive possibility implies the conjunctive possibility.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we must examine the context and the semantics of the modal operators.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we find that the original statement only guarantees that at least one of the possibilities is true, but it does not guarantee that both possibilities are true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the controversy surrounding wide-scope free choice inferences, we must rely on standard modal logic, which dictates that ♢p ∨ ♢q does not generally imply ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nAnswer: no"
