In standard modal logic, these two expressions do not have the same truth conditions.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we must consider the difference between disjunctive possibilities and conjunctive possibilities.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we find that the inference from ♢p ∨ ♢q to ♢p ∧ ♢q is a debated topic in semantics, known as the free choice inference pattern.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the controversy surrounding wide-scope free choice, we cannot conclude that the proposed inference is valid in standard modal logic.\n\nAnswer: no"
