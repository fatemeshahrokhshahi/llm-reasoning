The original statement is ♢p ∨ ♢q, and the proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression ♢p ∨ ♢q ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q, we need to consider if the disjunctive possibility implies the conjunctive possibility.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we must examine if the statement allows for both possibilities to be true simultaneously.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we must consider the controversy surrounding wide-scope free choice inferences. Standard modal logic does not generally imply ♢p ∧ ♢q from ♢p ∨ ♢q.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the controversy and the difference in truth conditions between disjunctive and conjunctive possibilities, we cannot infer 'Alice might visit the museum and she might go to the park' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
