The original statement is ♢p ∨ ♢q, and the proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement, we see that ♢p ∨ ♢q does not necessarily imply ♢p ∧ ♢q in standard modal logic. This is because 'might' denotes a possibility, and the possibility of either p or q does not guarantee the possibility of both p and q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we find that it is not generally accepted in standard modal logic. The statement 'The project might be completed early or it might be late' only implies that at least one of the possibilities is true, not that both are possible.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we see that the scope of 'might' is crucial. The original statement has a disjunctive possibility, whereas the proposed inference has a conjunctive possibility.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we conclude that the Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is not valid in this case.\n\nAnswer: no"
