The original statement is ♢p ∨ ♢q, and the proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement, we see that ♢p ∨ ♢q does not necessarily imply ♢p ∧ ♢q in standard modal logic. This is because 'might A or might B' only requires one of the possibilities to be true, whereas 'might A and might B' requires both possibilities to be true.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we find that it is not generally accepted in standard modal logic. The truth conditions for disjunctive possibilities (♢p ∨ ♢q) and conjunctive possibilities (♢p ∧ ♢q) are different.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we see that the original statement only guarantees that one of the possibilities is true, not both.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Therefore, we cannot determine that this Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
