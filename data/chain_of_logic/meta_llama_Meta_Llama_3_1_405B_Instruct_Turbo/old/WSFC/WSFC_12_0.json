The original statement is ♢p ∨ ♢q, and the proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression ♢p ∨ ♢q ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q, we need to consider if the disjunctive possibility implies the conjunctive possibility.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we examine if the original statement allows us to infer that both possibilities are true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we must consider the controversy surrounding wide-scope free choice inferences. Standard modal logic does not generally imply ♢p ∧ ♢q from ♢p ∨ ♢q.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the controversy and the standard modal logic rules, we determine that the Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is not valid in this case.\n\nAnswer: no"
