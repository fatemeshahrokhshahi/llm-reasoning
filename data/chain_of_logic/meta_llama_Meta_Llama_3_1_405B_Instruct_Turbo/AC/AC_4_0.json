      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and the consequent affirmation is \"The robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) gives us p = \"the alien visited Mars\" and q = \"the robot visited Jupiter\". The affirmation of the consequent q is given as \"The robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the alien visiting Mars leading to the robot visiting Jupiter, combined with the fact that the robot visited Jupiter, logically implies that the alien visited Mars.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this scenario means checking if the robot visiting Jupiter necessarily means the alien visited Mars.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional, it's clear that the statement only implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot would visit Jupiter, but it does not imply the reverse. There could be other reasons the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the one-directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes for the robot visiting Jupiter, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
