      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (p → q), and the consequent affirmation is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (q).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". The conditional statement p → q indicates that if p occurs, then q will occur.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining whether the occurrence of q (Mark buying the blue shirt) necessarily implies that p (Lisa buying the red shirt) occurred.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this scenario means checking if Mark buying the blue shirt (q) directly implies that Lisa bought the red shirt (p).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes, we recognize that conditionals work in one direction only. There could be multiple reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, not just because Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the one-directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes for Mark buying the blue shirt, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
