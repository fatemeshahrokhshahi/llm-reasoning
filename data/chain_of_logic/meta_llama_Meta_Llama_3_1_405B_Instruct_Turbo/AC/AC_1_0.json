      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (p → q), where p is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and q is \"Sue was at the wedding\". The consequent affirmation is \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have the conditional (p → q) and the affirmation of the consequent (q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement, we see that (p → q) ∧ q is given, but we need to determine if this implies p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - This is the critical step. We must remember that conditionals work in one direction only. The presence of Sue at the wedding could be due to multiple causes, not just Mary's presence. There could be other reasons Sue attended the wedding.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the one-directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes for Sue's presence at the wedding, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
