      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and the consequent affirmation is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"Tom watched football\" and q is \"Jen watched basketball\". The affirmation is q, which is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the combination of the conditional statement and the affirmation of its consequent logically leads to the affirmation of its antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this context. The question is whether we can infer \"Tom watched football\" from the given statements.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of conditionals and considering alternative causes. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not preclude other reasons for Jen watching basketball. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we must determine if affirming the consequent in this case is a valid inference.\n\nConsidering the CRITICAL RULE that affirming the consequent is a logical fallacy because conditionals work in one direction only and multiple causes can lead to the same effect, we cannot infer \"Tom watched football\" solely from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
