      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and the consequent affirmation is \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"Sue chose pizza\" and q is \"Bob chose pasta\". The affirmation of the consequent is q, which is \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the fact that \"Sue chose pizza\" leads to \"Bob chose pasta\" and that \"Bob chose pasta\" is indeed true, can logically deduce that \"Sue chose pizza\".\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this scenario. Given that \"Bob chose pasta\" could be the result of various choices not necessarily tied to Sue's choice, we must consider alternative causes.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional statement, it's clear that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" does not imply that Bob choosing pasta is exclusively dependent on Sue choosing pizza. There could be other reasons Bob chose pasta.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. The fact that \"Bob chose pasta\" does not logically imply that \"Sue chose pizza\" because the conditional works in one direction and there could be multiple reasons for Bob's choice.\n\nAnswer: no"
