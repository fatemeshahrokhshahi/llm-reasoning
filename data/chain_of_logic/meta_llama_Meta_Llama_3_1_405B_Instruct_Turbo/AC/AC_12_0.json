      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and the consequent affirmation is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) where p is \"Joe went to the park\" and q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\". The affirmation of the consequent q is given as \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the combination of the conditional statement and the affirmation of its consequent logically implies p (\"Joe went to the park\").\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this context. We are checking if from \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo\", we can logically infer \"Joe went to the park\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional, it's clear that the statement only implies that if Joe's action happens, then Lucy's action follows. It does not imply that Lucy's action can only be caused by Joe's action. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. The presence of Lucy at the zoo does not necessarily imply that Joe went to the park because the conditional only guarantees an outcome (Lucy going to the zoo) if a specific condition (Joe going to the park) is met, not that the condition is the only possible cause of the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no"
