We must remember that conditionals work in one direction only. Just because Kate ate the salad, it doesn't mean Ben ate pasta. There could be alternative reasons why Kate ate the salad.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the one-directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
