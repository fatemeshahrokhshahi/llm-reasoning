We also have the affirmation of q, which is \"The unicorn was in the forest\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the presence of the unicorn in the forest, which is a consequence of the griffin's presence, necessarily implies the griffin's presence.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this scenario. The question asks if we can infer the presence of the griffin from the presence of the unicorn.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional, it's clear that the presence of the unicorn does not exclusively depend on the presence of the griffin. There could be other reasons for the unicorn's presence in the forest. The conditional works in one direction only: if the griffin is present, then the unicorn is present, but not the other way around.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the one-directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes for the unicorn's presence, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
