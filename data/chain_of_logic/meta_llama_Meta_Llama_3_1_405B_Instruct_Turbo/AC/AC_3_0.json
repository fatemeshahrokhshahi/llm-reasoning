The affirmation of the consequent q is given as \"The book is a mystery novel\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing (p → q) ∧ q, we are examining if the affirmation of the consequent q (\"The book is a mystery novel\") logically implies p (\"the book was written by James\").\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this context. The question is whether we can infer p (\"the book was written by James\") from the affirmation of q (\"The book is a mystery novel\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Critically examining the directional nature of the conditional, it's clear that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" only guarantees that books written by James are mystery novels, but it does not preclude other authors from writing mystery novels. Thus, there could be alternative causes (other authors) leading to the same effect (a mystery novel).\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the one-directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of multiple causes leading to the same effect, affirming the consequent in this case does not logically imply the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no"
