Since Erin did not take a train, we can infer something about Sam's actions.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combine the answers to evaluate the logic.\n- With B being false (¬B), and knowing the conditional rule (A → B), we can apply the Modus Tollens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Apply Modus Tollens rule to reach conclusion.\n- Given (A → B) ∧ ¬B, we can conclude ¬A according to the Modus Tollens rule.\n- Therefore, since Erin did not take a train, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
