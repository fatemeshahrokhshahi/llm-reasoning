The question is whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B = 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A, where A → B represents 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', ¬B represents 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', and ¬A represents 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B ('Mark bought the blue shirt') is false. According to the conditional rule, if A ('Lisa bought the red shirt') is true, then B should be true. However, since B is false, the conditional tells us that A cannot be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have the conditional rule (A → B) and the fact that B is false (¬B). \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we conclude that if A implies B and B is false, then A must be false. Therefore, we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
