The question is whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = \"the doll was plastic\" and B = \"the truck was metal\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A, where A is \"the doll was plastic\" and B is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B (\"the truck was metal\") is false. According to the conditional rule, if A then B. Since B is false, we need to evaluate what this tells us about A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we know that if the doll was plastic, the truck would be metal. However, the truck is not metal. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that since the truck was not metal (¬B), and if the doll was plastic then the truck would be metal (A → B), it logically follows that the doll was not plastic (¬A).\n\nAnswer: yes"
