The proposed distribution is □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement, we see that it follows the pattern of □(p ∨ q) which does not necessarily imply □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if modal necessity distributes over disjunction, we find that it does not.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators, we see that the original statement only requires that at least one of the conditions (elevator or wheelchair ramps) must have been met, but it does not require that either condition individually must have been met. The proposed distribution changes the scope of the modal operator, which is a logical fallacy.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we conclude that the modal distribution is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
