      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' and 'Tom watched football'. The question is whether we can infer 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Tom watched football' and B = 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?, where A = 'Tom watched football' and B = 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the antecedent A ('Tom watched football') is true. According to the conditional rule, if A is true, then B ('Jen watched basketball') should also be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have the conditional rule 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' and the fact that 'Tom watched football'. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B, we can conclude that if 'Tom watched football' (A) and 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' (A → B), then 'Jen watched basketball' (B) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
