The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combine the answers to evaluate the logic.\nGiven that the vampire was awake (A is true), and knowing that if the vampire was awake then the mummy was awake (A → B), we can infer that the conditions for applying Modus Ponens are met.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Apply Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion.\nApplying Modus Ponens, ((Vampire awake → Mummy awake) ∧ Vampire awake) ⊢ Mummy awake, we conclude that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
