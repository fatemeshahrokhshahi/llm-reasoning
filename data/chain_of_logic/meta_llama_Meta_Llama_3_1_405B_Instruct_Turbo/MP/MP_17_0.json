The question is whether we can infer 'Kate ate the salad'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Ben ate pasta' and B = 'Kate ate the salad'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?, where A is 'Ben ate pasta', B is 'Kate ate the salad', and ⊢ denotes 'can we infer'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The antecedent A is true ('Ben ate pasta'), and the conditional tells us that if A is true, then B is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent and a conditional rule linking the antecedent to the consequent.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that if A is true and A implies B, then B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
