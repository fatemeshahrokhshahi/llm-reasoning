The question is whether we can infer 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Jeff played basketball' and B = 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?, where A → B represents 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', and A represents 'Jeff played basketball'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The antecedent A is true, as it is given that 'Jeff played basketball'. The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent and a conditional rule that links the antecedent to the consequent.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B is true, since (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B is a valid logical form.\n\nAnswer: yes"
