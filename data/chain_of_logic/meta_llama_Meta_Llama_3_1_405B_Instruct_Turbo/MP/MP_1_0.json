The question is whether we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Mary was at the wedding' and B = 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?, where A is 'Mary was at the wedding', B is 'Sue was at the wedding', and ⊢ denotes 'can we infer'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the antecedent A ('Mary was at the wedding') is true. The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B ('Sue was at the wedding') is also true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent A and a conditional rule that states if A is true, then B is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B ('Sue was at the wedding') is indeed true, since A is true and the conditional rule states that A implies B.\n\nAnswer: yes"
