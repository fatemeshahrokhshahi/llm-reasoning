The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combine the answers to evaluate the logic.\nSince A is true, and the conditional states that if A is true then B is true, we can conclude that B must be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Apply Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion.\nAccording to Modus Ponens, (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B. Therefore, given that the apple was red and the conditional rule, we can logically infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes"
