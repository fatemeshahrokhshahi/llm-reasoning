      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The car was red\". The question is whether we can infer \"The truck was blue\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = \"The car was red\" and B = \"The truck was blue\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?, where A → B represents \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and A represents \"The car was red\".\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The antecedent A is true, as it is given that \"The car was red\". The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent and a conditional rule that links the antecedent to the consequent.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that if A is true and A → B is true, then B must be true. Therefore, we can infer \"The truck was blue\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
