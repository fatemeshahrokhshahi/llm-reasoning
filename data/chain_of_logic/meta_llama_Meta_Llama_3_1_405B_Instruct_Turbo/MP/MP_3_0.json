The question is whether we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The book was written by James' and B = 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?, where A → B represents 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', A represents 'The book was written by James', and B represents 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the antecedent A ('The book was written by James') is true. According to the conditional rule, if A is true, then B ('The book is a mystery novel') should also be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent (A) and a conditional rule that tells us if A is true, then B is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B ('The book is a mystery novel') is indeed true, since A is true and the conditional rule A → B holds.\n\nAnswer: yes"
