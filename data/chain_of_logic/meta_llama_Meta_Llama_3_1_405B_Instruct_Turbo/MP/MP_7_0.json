The question is whether we can infer 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Alex finished the race' and B = 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?, where A → B represents 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', A represents 'Alex finished the race', and B represents 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the antecedent A ('Alex finished the race') is true. The conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B ('Chris finished the race') is also true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent (A) and a conditional rule that links A to B.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B ('Chris finished the race') is true, since A is true and we have the conditional rule A → B.\n\nAnswer: yes"
