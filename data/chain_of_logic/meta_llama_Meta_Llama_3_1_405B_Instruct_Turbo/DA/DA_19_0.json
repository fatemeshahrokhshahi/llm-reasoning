The question is whether we can infer 'Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A (Tom watched football) and B (Jen watched basketball).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (Tom did not watch football) allows us to conclude B is false (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Jen could have watched basketball for many reasons other than Tom watching football. There is no direct causal link or exclusive condition that Jen only watches basketball if Tom watches football.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that this is an instance of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. The conclusion that Jen did not watch basketball based solely on Tom not watching football and the initial conditional statement is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
