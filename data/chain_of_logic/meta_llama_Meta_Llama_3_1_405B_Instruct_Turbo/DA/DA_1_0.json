The question is whether we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A (Mary was at the wedding) and B (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (Mary was not at the wedding) allows us to conclude B is false (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Sue could have been at the wedding for many other reasons besides Mary being there. Perhaps Sue is a close friend of the couple, or a family member.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that there are other possible reasons for Sue to be at the wedding, we cannot conclude that Sue was not at the wedding simply because Mary was not. This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
