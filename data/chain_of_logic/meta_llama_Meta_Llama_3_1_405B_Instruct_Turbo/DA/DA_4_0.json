The alien did not visit Mars.\nThe question is: Can we infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter?\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The alien visited Mars\nB = The robot visited Jupiter\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: \n(A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false:\nKnowing the alien did not visit Mars (A is false) does not directly tell us anything about the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A:\nYes, there could be many reasons the robot visited Jupiter that have nothing to do with the alien visiting Mars. The robot's visit to Jupiter is not solely dependent on the alien's actions.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy:\nThis is indeed the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy because we are trying to conclude that the robot did not visit Jupiter solely based on the alien not visiting Mars, which is not a valid logical conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
