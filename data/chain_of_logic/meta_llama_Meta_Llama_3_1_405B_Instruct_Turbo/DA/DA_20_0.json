The banana's color is independent of the apple's color in this context.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY\n- Yes, this is a classic example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. Just because the condition (the apple being red) is not met, it does not mean the consequence (the banana being yellow) cannot occur.\n\nAnswer: no"
