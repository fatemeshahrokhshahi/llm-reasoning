The question is whether we can infer 'The mummy was not awake'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A (the vampire was awake) and B (the mummy was awake).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (the vampire was not awake) does not necessarily allow us to conclude B is false (the mummy was not awake).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we see that the mummy could be awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire's state. Perhaps there was a full moon, or some other event occurred that awoke the mummy.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is a case of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. We cannot conclude that the mummy was not awake simply because the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
