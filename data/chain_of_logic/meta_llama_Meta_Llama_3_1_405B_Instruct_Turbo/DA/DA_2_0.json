The griffin was not in the forest.\nThe question is: Can we infer that the unicorn was not in the forest?\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The griffin was in the forest.\nB = The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false:\nKnowing the griffin was not in the forest (¬A) does not directly tell us about the unicorn's presence.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A:\nYes, there could be other reasons the unicorn was in the forest, unrelated to the griffin's presence. Perhaps the unicorn likes the forest environment, or maybe it was invited by another creature.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy:\nYes, it is. The argument assumes that because the griffin was not in the forest (¬A), the unicorn was not in the forest (¬B), which is a logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
