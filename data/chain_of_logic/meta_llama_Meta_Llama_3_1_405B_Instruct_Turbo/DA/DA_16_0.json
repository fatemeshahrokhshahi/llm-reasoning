      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The shirt was not cotton\". The question is whether we can infer \"The pants were not denim\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = \"the shirt was cotton\" and B = \"the pants were denim\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (\"The shirt was not cotton\") allows us to conclude B is false (\"The pants were not denim\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the pants could still be denim even if the shirt is not cotton. There is no rule stating that denim pants are exclusively paired with cotton shirts.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that B could be true for reasons other than A, we determine that this is an instance of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
