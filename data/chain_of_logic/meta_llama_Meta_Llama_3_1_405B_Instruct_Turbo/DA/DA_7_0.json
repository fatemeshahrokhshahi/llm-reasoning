The question is whether we can infer 'Chris did not finish the race'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A (Alex finished the race) and B (Chris finished the race).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (Alex did not finish the race) allows us to conclude B is false (Chris did not finish the race).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Chris could have finished the race for reasons unrelated to Alex's performance. Chris's completion of the race is not solely dependent on Alex finishing.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that B (Chris finished the race) could be true for reasons other than A (Alex finished the race), we determine that this is an instance of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. The conclusion that Chris did not finish the race based on Alex not finishing is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
