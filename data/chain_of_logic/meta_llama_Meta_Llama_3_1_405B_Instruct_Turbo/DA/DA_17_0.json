The question is whether we can infer \"Kate did not eat the salad\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = \"Ben ate pasta\" and B = \"Kate ate the salad\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (\"Ben did not eat pasta\") allows us to conclude B is false (\"Kate did not eat the salad\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Kate could have eaten the salad for many reasons other than Ben eating pasta. Perhaps she simply likes salad, or maybe someone else ate pasta and she still chose the salad.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that there are other ways for Kate to have eaten the salad without Ben eating pasta, we cannot conclude that Kate did not eat the salad simply because Ben did not eat pasta. This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
