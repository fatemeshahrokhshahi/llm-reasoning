The question is whether we can infer \"The truck was not blue\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = \"the car was red\" and B = \"the truck was blue\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (\"The car was not red\") allows us to conclude B is false (\"The truck was not blue\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the truck could be blue for many reasons other than the car being red. The color of the truck is not solely dependent on the color of the car.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that there are other ways B could be true without A, we determine that this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. The conclusion \"The truck was not blue\" does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
