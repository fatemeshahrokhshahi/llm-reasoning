Sue did not choose pizza.\nThe question is: Can we infer that Bob did not choose pasta?\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = Sue chose pizza\nB = Bob chose pasta\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: \n(A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false:\nKnowing Sue did not choose pizza (¬A) does not directly tell us what Bob chose.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A:\nThere could be many reasons why Bob chose pasta that have nothing to do with Sue's choice. Bob's choice of pasta is not solely dependent on Sue choosing pizza.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy:\nThis is indeed the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy because we are trying to conclude that Bob did not choose pasta (¬B) based solely on Sue not choosing pizza (¬A), which does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
