The question is whether we can infer \"The cat was not outside\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = \"the dog was inside\" and B = \"the cat was outside\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - If we know A is false (the dog was not inside), we are trying to conclude B is false (the cat was not outside).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - This is the critical step. Just because the dog was not inside, it does not mean the cat was not outside. There could be other reasons the cat was outside that have nothing to do with the dog's location.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that there are other possible reasons for the cat to be outside, we cannot conclude that the cat was not outside simply because the dog was not inside. This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
