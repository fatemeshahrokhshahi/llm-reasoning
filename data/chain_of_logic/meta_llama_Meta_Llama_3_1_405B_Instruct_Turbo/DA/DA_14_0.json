The wolf's presence in the den is not solely dependent on the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY:\nYes, it is. We cannot conclude the wolf was not in the den simply because the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no"
