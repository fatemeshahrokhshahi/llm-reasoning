The question is whether we can infer \"Amy did not play tennis\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = \"Jeff played basketball\" and B = \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (\"Jeff did not play basketball\") allows us to conclude B is false (\"Amy did not play tennis\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Amy could have played tennis for many reasons other than Jeff playing basketball. Perhaps she played tennis with someone else, or maybe she played in a tournament.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that B could be true for reasons other than A, we determine that this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. The conclusion \"Amy did not play tennis\" does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
