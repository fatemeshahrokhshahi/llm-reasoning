The question is whether we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B = 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false ('Lisa did not buy the red shirt') allows us to conclude B is false ('Mark did not buy the blue shirt').\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Mark could have bought the blue shirt for reasons unrelated to Lisa buying the red shirt. Perhaps Mark simply liked the blue shirt, or maybe someone else suggested it to him.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that there are other possible reasons for Mark buying the blue shirt, we cannot conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt simply because Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is an instance of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
