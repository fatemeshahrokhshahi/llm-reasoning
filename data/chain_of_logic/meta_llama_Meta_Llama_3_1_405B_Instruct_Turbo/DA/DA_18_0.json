      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The doll was not plastic\". The question is whether we can infer \"The truck was not metal\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = \"the doll was plastic\" and B = \"the truck was metal\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (\"The doll was not plastic\") allows us to conclude B is false (\"The truck was not metal\").\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the truck could still be metal for reasons unrelated to the doll's material. The condition only guarantees the truck is metal if the doll is plastic, but it does not preclude the truck from being metal under other circumstances.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that B could be true for reasons other than A, concluding ¬B from ¬A would be the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
