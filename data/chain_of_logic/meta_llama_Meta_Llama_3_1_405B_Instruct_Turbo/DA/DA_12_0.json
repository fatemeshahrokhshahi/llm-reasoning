The question is whether we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A (Joe went to the park) and B (Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (Joe did not go to the park) allows us to conclude B is false (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Lucy could have gone to the zoo for many reasons other than Joe going to the park. Perhaps she went with someone else, or maybe she decided to go alone.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that B could be true for reasons other than A, we determine that this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. The conclusion 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
