The original statement only guarantees that if the doll is plastic, the truck will be metal, but it does not provide information about the material of the doll based on the material of the truck.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, it's entirely possible for the truck to be metal without the doll being plastic. The material of the truck does not depend on the material of the doll.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that attempting to infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is an example of the conversion fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
