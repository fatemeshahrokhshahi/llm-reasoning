      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" We are asked to infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, A = \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B = \"Sue was at the wedding\". The converse of the original statement is indeed \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of our question is: (Mary was at the wedding → Sue was at the wedding) → (Sue was at the wedding → Mary was at the wedding)?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not inherently prove its converse. The presence of Sue at the wedding is not solely dependent on Mary's presence according to the original statement.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, it's entirely possible for Sue to be at the wedding without Mary being there. The original statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary is there, not that Mary's presence is required for Sue to be there.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, attempting to infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is an example of the conversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: no"
