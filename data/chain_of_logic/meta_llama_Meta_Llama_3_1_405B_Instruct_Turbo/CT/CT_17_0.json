Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the contrapositive indeed logically follows from the original statement. The elements correctly match the form (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A).\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can confidently infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
