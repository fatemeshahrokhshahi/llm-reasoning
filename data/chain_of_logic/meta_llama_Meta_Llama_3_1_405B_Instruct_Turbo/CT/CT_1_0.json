The transformation from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" to \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" is a correct application of contraposition.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can confidently infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
