      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" We are asked to infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = \"the shirt was cotton\" and B = \"the pants were denim.\" The contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton,\" which is exactly what we're asked to infer.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\" The logical expression for the contrapositive is indeed \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton,\" or (¬B → ¬A).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that \"If A, then B\" always implies \"If ¬B, then ¬A.\" Therefore, from the original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we can logically infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the original statement's elements are correctly negated and reversed in the contrapositive. This confirms that our application of contraposition is valid.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can confidently infer the contrapositive statement from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
