Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the contrapositive directly addresses the scenario of the cat not being outside, leading to the conclusion that the dog was not inside.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since contraposition is a universally valid logical principle, we can conclude that the inference from the original statement to its contrapositive is logically sound.\n\nAnswer: yes"
