  "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a nested conditional structure: if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be. The probability claims are: it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, and it is likely banana bread will be top (hence chocolate chip cookies won’t be).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down into elements, we have probabilities (banana bread likely to be top, carrot cake far behind), nested conditionals (if chocolate chip cookies aren’t top, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be), and the question (does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be?).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the structure: If p → (q → r) where p is the likelihood of banana bread not being top and chocolate chip cookies not being top, q is banana bread not being top, and r is carrot cake being top. Given that banana bread is likely to be top, we have p is unlikely.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals, we see that even though banana bread being top makes it unlikely that chocolate chip cookies are top, this doesn’t directly affect the probability of carrot cake being top given banana bread isn’t.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution, carrot cake is far behind in sales. The nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem because the low probability of carrot cake being top doesn’t change significantly just because banana bread isn’t top.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the Complex Modus Ponens inference and McGee's counterexample, we see that the inference breaks down with probability/likelihood. The likelihood of banana bread being top doesn’t transfer to make it likely that carrot cake will be top if banana bread isn’t.\n\nAnswer: no"
