      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" We are asked to infer \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = \"Jeff played basketball\" and B = \"Amy played tennis.\" The inverse would be \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" which is (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its inverse. Just because Jeff playing basketball implies Amy played tennis, it doesn't necessarily mean that if Jeff didn't play basketball, Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that Amy could have played tennis regardless of whether Jeff played basketball or not. There's no direct dependency of Amy's tennis on Jeff not playing basketball.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is a case of the \"Inversion\" fallacy, as we're trying to infer the inverse from the original conditional statement, which is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
