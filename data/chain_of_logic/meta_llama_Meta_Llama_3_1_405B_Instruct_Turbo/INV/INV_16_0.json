      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" We are asked to infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A (the shirt was cotton) and B (the pants were denim). The inverse would be \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" which is (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of what we're trying to infer is (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not inherently prove its inverse. The original statement only guarantees that if the shirt is cotton, the pants will be denim, but it does not provide information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that the pants being denim does not depend solely on the shirt being cotton. There's no logical reason why the pants couldn't be denim even if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, attempting to infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is an example of the inversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
