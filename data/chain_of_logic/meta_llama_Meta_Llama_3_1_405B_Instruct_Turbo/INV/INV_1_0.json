The inverse of the original statement is indeed \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of what we're trying to determine is: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not inherently prove its inverse. The presence of Mary guarantees the presence of Sue, but it does not guarantee that Sue's presence is dependent solely on Mary's presence.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we find that yes, Sue could still have been at the wedding even if Mary was not. There is no information suggesting that Sue's attendance is strictly dependent on Mary's attendance.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that attempting to infer \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" from the original statement is an example of the inversion fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
