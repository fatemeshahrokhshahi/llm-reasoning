The inverse would be \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its inverse. The original statement only guarantees the truck was blue if the car was red, but it does not provide information about the truck's color if the car was not red.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that the truck could still be blue even if the car was not red. There is no logical connection that requires the truck's color to be dependent on the car's color in the inverse scenario.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is indeed the \"Inversion\" FALLACY. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
