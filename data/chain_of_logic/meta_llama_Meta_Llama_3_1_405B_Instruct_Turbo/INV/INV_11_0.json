It only guarantees that if the cake was chocolate, the muffins were blueberry, but it does not say anything about the muffins when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that the muffins could still be blueberry even if the cake was not chocolate. There's no logical connection that necessitates the muffins to not be blueberry just because the cake isn't chocolate.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is a clear case of the \"Inversion\" fallacy. The original statement does not logically imply its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
