The inverse would be \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)? \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its inverse. Just because Ben eating pasta implies Kate ate salad, it doesn't mean that if Ben didn't eat pasta, Kate didn't eat salad.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false: Kate could still have eaten salad even if Ben didn't eat pasta. There's no logical connection that would prevent Kate from eating salad if Ben didn't eat pasta.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is indeed the \"Inversion\" FALLACY. According to the critical rule, \"If A, then B\" does NOT imply \"If ¬A, then ¬B\".\n\nAnswer: no"
