The inverse of the original statement would be \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train,\" which is what we're asked to infer.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of what we're trying to determine is: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" does not inherently prove its inverse. The original statement only guarantees that if Sam took a plane, Erin took a train, but it does not provide information about what happens if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that Erin could still have taken a train even if Sam did not take a plane. The original statement does not preclude this possibility.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that attempting to infer \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is an example of the inversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
