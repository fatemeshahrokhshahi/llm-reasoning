Just because Sue choosing pizza implies Bob chose pasta, it doesn't automatically mean that if Sue didn't choose pizza, Bob didn't choose pasta.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that Bob could still have chosen pasta even if Sue didn't choose pizza. The original statement doesn't restrict Bob's choice to only be dependent on Sue's choice of pizza.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that inferring \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" from \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is an example of the inversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail the inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
