The original statement only guarantees that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside, but it does not provide information about the cat's location when the dog is not inside.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that the cat could indeed still be outside even if the dog is not inside. There's no logical connection provided by the original statement that would necessitate the cat to be inside just because the dog is not inside.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, attempting to infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is an example of the inversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
