The statement only guarantees that if James wrote the book, it's a mystery novel, but it doesn't provide information about books not written by James.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that the book could indeed be a mystery novel even if it wasn't written by James. There are likely many mystery novels written by authors other than James.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that attempting to infer \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" from the original statement is an example of the inversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
