It does not provide information about the state of the mummy when the vampire is not awake.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the situation, we see that B (the mummy being awake) could still be true even when A (the vampire being awake) is false. There's no logical connection given that would necessitate the mummy to be asleep just because the vampire is asleep.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that attempting to infer \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" from \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is an example of the inversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
