      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We are asked to infer \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, A = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". The inverse would be \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", which is what we're asked to infer.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide evidence that proves its inverse. It only states what happens if Lisa bought the red shirt, not what happens if she didn't.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that Mark buying the blue shirt is not dependent on Lisa not buying the red shirt. Mark could still buy the blue shirt regardless of Lisa's actions.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is a case of the \"Inversion\" fallacy. The original statement does not logically imply the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
