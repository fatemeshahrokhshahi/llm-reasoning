      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" We are asked to infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A (the doll was plastic) and B (the truck was metal). The inverse would be \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal,\" which is what we're asked to infer.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of what we're trying to determine is: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not inherently prove its inverse. The original statement only guarantees that if the doll is plastic, the truck is metal, but it does not provide information about the material of the truck if the doll is not plastic.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that the truck could indeed still be metal even if the doll is not plastic. The original statement does not exclude this possibility.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that attempting to infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" from \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is an example of the inversion fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
