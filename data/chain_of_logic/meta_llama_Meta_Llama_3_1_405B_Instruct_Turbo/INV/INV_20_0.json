The original statement only guarantees that if the apple is red, the banana is yellow, but it does not provide information about the color of the banana if the apple is not red.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that the banana could indeed still be yellow even if the apple is not red. The original statement does not exclude this possibility.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that attempting to infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is an example of the inversion fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
