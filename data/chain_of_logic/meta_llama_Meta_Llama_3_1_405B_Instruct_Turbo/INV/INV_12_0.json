The inverse would be \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its inverse. The original statement only guarantees that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that Lucy could still have gone to the zoo even if Joe did not go to the park. The original statement does not rule out this possibility.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is indeed the \"Inversion\" FALLACY. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
