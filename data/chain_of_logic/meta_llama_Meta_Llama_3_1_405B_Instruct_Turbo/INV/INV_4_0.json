The original statement only guarantees that if the alien visited Mars, the robot visited Jupiter. It does not provide information about what happens if the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that there's no logical contradiction for the robot to visit Jupiter even if the alien did not visit Mars. The original statement does not restrict the robot's actions based on the alien's non-visit to Mars.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, attempting to infer \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter\" from \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is an example of the inversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
