It does not provide information about what happens if Alex didn't finish the race.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that Chris could still finish the race even if Alex didn't. The original statement does not imply a dependency of Chris's completion on Alex's non-completion.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we determine that inferring \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race\" from \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is an example of the inversion fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
