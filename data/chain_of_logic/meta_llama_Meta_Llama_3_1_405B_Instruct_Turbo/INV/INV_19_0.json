      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" We are asked to infer \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = \"Tom watched football\" and B = \"Jen watched basketball.\" The inverse would be \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball,\" which is (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?, where A = \"Tom watched football\" and B = \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its inverse. Just because Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball, it doesn't mean that Tom not watching football implies Jen not watching basketball.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that Jen could still have watched basketball even if Tom did not watch football. There's no logical connection that would prevent Jen from watching basketball if Tom didn't watch football.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is a case of the \"Inversion\" fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
