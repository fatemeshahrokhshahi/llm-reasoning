The presence of the griffin being a condition for the unicorn's presence does not logically dictate that the absence of the griffin means the absence of the unicorn.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we see that the unicorn could indeed be in the forest even if the griffin is not. The original statement only guarantees the unicorn's presence if the griffin is there, but it does not preclude the unicorn's presence in the absence of the griffin.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, attempting to infer \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" from \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is an example of the inversion fallacy. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
