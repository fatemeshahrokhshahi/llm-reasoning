This means that if we have a conditional statement with 'must' and the negation of necessity, we can infer the negation of the antecedent.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - CRITICAL: Examine the modal scope and logical relationships. \n  The modal scope of 'must' applies to Sue being at the wedding, given the condition of Mary being at the wedding. The negation of this necessity directly contradicts the conditional statement, thus supporting the application of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid. \n  Given the CRITICAL RULE and the analysis above, we can conclude that the Modal Modus Tollens is indeed valid in this case.\n\nAnswer: yes"
