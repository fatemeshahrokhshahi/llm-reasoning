      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original modal statement is 'Tom might buy a car or he might buy a motorcycle', and the proposed inference is 'Tom might buy a car and he might buy a motorcycle'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, 'Tom might buy a car or he might buy a motorcycle' can be decomposed into 'Tom might buy a car' (♢p) and 'Tom might buy a motorcycle' (♢q). The proposed inference can be decomposed into 'Tom might buy a car' (♢p) and 'Tom might buy a motorcycle' (♢q) combined with 'and'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between 'Tom might buy a car or he might buy a motorcycle' (♢p ∨ ♢q) and 'Tom might buy a car and he might buy a motorcycle' (♢p ∧ ♢q), we need to determine if the former implies the latter.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we need to consider whether 'Tom might buy a car or he might buy a motorcycle' implies that both options are possible.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we need to consider whether the disjunctive possibilities ('Tom might buy a car or he might buy a motorcycle') imply the conjunctive possibilities ('Tom might buy a car and he might buy a motorcycle'). In standard modal logic, these have different truth conditions.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is valid, we need to consider whether the inference is generally accepted in standard modal logic.\n\nAnswer: no"
