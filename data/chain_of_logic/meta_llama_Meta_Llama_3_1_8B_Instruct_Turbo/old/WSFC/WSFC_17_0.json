The proposed inference 'The flight might be delayed and it might be on time' can be decomposed into 'The flight might be delayed' (♢p) and 'The flight might be on time' (♢q) as well.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression, we have ♢p ∨ ♢q (The flight might be delayed or it might be on time) and ♢p ∧ ♢q (The flight might be delayed and it might be on time). We need to determine if ♢p ∨ ♢q ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we need to consider the scope of the modal operators and the free choice reasoning. In standard modal logic, 'might' is a possibility operator, and it does not generally imply conjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we can see that 'The flight might be delayed or it might be on time' implies that at least one of the possibilities is true. However, it does not imply that both possibilities are true. This is a classic example of the difference between disjunctive possibilities and conjunctive possibilities.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is valid, we can conclude that it is not generally valid in standard modal logic. The inference 'The flight might be delayed or it might be on time' does not necessarily imply 'The flight might be delayed and it might be on time'.\n\nAnswer: no"
