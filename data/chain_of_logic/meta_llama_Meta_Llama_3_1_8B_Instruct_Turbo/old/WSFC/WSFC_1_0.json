In this case, the scope is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that 'might' applies to both 'clean his room' and 'go to the lecture'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we note that standard modal logic does not generally imply that 'might A or might B' implies 'might A and might B'. This is because the truth conditions for disjunctive possibilities and conjunctive possibilities are different.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is valid, we conclude that it is not generally valid in standard modal logic. The inference from 'John might clean his room or he might go to the lecture' to 'John might clean his room and he might go to the lecture' is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no"
