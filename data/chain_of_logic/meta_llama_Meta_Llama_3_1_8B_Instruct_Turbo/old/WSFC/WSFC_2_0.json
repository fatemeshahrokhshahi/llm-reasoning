The proposed inference 'Alice might visit the museum and she might go to the park' can be decomposed into 'Alice might visit the museum' (♢p) and 'Alice might go to the park' (♢q) combined with a conjunction.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression, we have ♢p ∨ ♢q (Alice might visit the museum or she might go to the park) and ♢p ∧ ♢q (Alice might visit the museum and she might go to the park). We need to determine if ♢p ∨ ♢q ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we need to consider the scope of the modal operators and the free choice reasoning. In standard modal logic, 'might' is a possibility operator, and it does not generally imply conjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we can see that the wide-scope free choice inference is controversial. The original statement 'Alice might visit the museum or she might go to the park' does not necessarily imply that both possibilities are true. It only suggests that at least one of the possibilities is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is valid, we can conclude that it is not generally valid in standard modal logic. The original statement does not imply the conjunction of the two possibilities.\n\nAnswer: no"
