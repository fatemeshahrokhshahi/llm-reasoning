The proposed inference can be decomposed into ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression, we need to determine if ♢p ∨ ♢q ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q. In standard modal logic, this is not generally true.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we need to examine the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning. In this case, the scope of the modal operator 'might' is not explicitly stated, but it is generally assumed to be wide-scope.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we can see that the wide-scope free choice inference is not valid in standard modal logic. This is because 'might A or might B' does not generally imply 'might A and might B'.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is valid, we conclude that it is not valid in standard modal logic.\n\nAnswer: no"
