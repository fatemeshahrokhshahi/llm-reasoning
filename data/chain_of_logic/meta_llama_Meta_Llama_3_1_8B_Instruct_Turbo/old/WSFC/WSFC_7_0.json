The proposed inference can be decomposed into 'The team might win the match' (♢p) and 'The team might lose the match' (♢q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression, we have ♢p ∨ ♢q (The team might win or they might lose) and ♢p ∧ ♢q (The team might win the match and they might lose the match). We need to determine if ♢p ∨ ♢q ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we need to consider the scope of the modal operators and the free choice reasoning. In standard modal logic, 'might' is a possibility operator, and it does not generally imply conjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we can see that 'The team might win or they might lose' does not necessarily imply that both possibilities are true at the same time. This is a free choice inference pattern that is debated in semantics.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is valid, we can conclude that it is not generally valid in standard modal logic. The difference between disjunctive possibilities and conjunctive possibilities has different truth conditions.\n\nAnswer: no"
