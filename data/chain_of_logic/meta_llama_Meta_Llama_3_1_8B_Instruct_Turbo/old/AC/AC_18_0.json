      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' (p → q), and the consequent affirmation is 'The truck was metal' (q). We are trying to infer 'The doll was plastic' (p).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) and the consequent affirmation (q) gives us 'If the doll was plastic' (p) and 'then the truck was metal' (q), and 'The truck was metal' (q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → q) ∧ q, we see that it combines the conditional statement with the consequent affirmation. However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid. In this case, affirming the consequent (the truck was metal) does not necessarily imply the antecedent (the doll was plastic).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes, we see that the statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' only implies that if the doll was plastic, the truck would be metal. It does not imply that if the truck is metal, the doll must be plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we conclude that it is not. The statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and 'The truck was metal' does not entail 'The doll was plastic'. This is a fundamental logical fallacy known as Affirming the Consequent.\n\nAnswer: no"
