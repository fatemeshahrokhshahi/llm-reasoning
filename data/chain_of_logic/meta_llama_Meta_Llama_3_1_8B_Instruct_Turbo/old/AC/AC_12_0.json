However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - If we affirm the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo), it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If A, then B' only implies that if A is true, then B is true, but not the other way around. In this case, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park just because Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we see that it is not. The conditional statement and the affirmation of the consequent do not entail the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no"
