However, this does not necessarily imply that the antecedent (p) is true.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid. In this case, affirming the consequent would mean that if the mummy was awake, we can infer that the vampire was awake. However, this is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons for the mummy being awake.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes, we see that the conditional statement only implies that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. It does not imply that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. There could be other reasons for the mummy being awake, such as the presence of a different person or a different external factor.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we conclude that it is not valid. The conditional statement and the consequent affirmation do not necessarily imply that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
