      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' and the consequent affirmation is 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'p' as 'Sue chose pizza' and 'q' as 'Bob chose pasta'. The consequent affirmation is 'q', which is 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - We are analyzing if '(p → q) ∧ q ⊢ p'. Here, 'p → q' means 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', and 'q' is 'Bob chose pasta'. So, we are checking if '(If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta) and (Bob chose pasta)' implies 'Sue chose pizza'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid. In this case, affirming the consequent means if we know 'Bob chose pasta', we can infer 'Sue chose pizza'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes, we see that 'If A, then B' and 'B' does NOT imply 'A'. This is a fundamental logical fallacy. Conditionals work in one direction only, and multiple causes can lead to the same effect. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue chose pizza' from 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' and 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we conclude that it is not valid. We cannot infer 'Sue chose pizza' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
