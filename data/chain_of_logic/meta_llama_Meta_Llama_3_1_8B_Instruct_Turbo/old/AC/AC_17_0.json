However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the process of inferring the antecedent (p) from the conditional statement (p → q) and the consequent affirmation (q). However, this is a known logical fallacy.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If A, then B' only implies that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not imply that if B is true, then A must be true. Additionally, multiple causes can lead to the same effect, so even if Kate ate the salad, it does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the above analysis, affirming the consequent is invalid, and we cannot infer 'Ben ate pasta' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
