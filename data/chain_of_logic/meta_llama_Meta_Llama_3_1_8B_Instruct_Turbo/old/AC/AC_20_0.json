However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that if the consequent (q) is true, then the antecedent (p) must also be true. However, this is not a valid inference.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If A, then B' only implies that if A is true, then B must be true, but it does not imply that if B is true, then A must be true. In this case, the banana being yellow could be caused by many factors, not just the apple being red.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if the Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we conclude that it is not. The statement (p → q) ∧ q does not entail p.\n\nAnswer: no"
