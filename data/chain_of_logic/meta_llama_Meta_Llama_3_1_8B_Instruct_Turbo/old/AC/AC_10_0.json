However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that 'If A, then B' and 'B' implies 'A'. In this case, 'The cat was outside' does not necessarily mean 'The dog was inside'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The conditional statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' only works in one direction. It does not imply that if the cat was outside, the dog must have been inside. There could be other reasons why the cat was outside.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since affirming the consequent is a fundamental logical fallacy, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' together with 'The cat was outside'.\n\nAnswer: no"
