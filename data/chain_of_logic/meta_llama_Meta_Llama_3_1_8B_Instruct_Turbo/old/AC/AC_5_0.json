      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', and the consequent affirmation is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'Jeff played basketball' (p) as the antecedent and 'Amy played tennis' (q) as the consequent.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement '(p → q) ∧ q', we see that it combines the conditional statement with the affirmation of the consequent. However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid. In this case, affirming the consequent (Amy played tennis) does not necessarily imply the antecedent (Jeff played basketball).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that the conditional statement only implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not imply that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we conclude that it is not valid. This is because affirming the consequent (Amy played tennis) does not entail the antecedent (Jeff played basketball). This is a fundamental logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
