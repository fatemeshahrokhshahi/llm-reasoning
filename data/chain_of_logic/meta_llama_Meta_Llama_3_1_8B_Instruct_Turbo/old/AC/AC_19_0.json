      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' (p → q), and the consequent affirmation is 'Jen watched basketball' (q). \n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) and the consequent affirmation (q) gives us 'If Tom watched football' (p) and 'Jen watched basketball' (q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → q) ∧ q, we see that it combines the conditional statement with the consequent affirmation. However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that because the consequent (q) is true, the antecedent (p) must also be true. However, this is not a valid inference.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that the conditional statement (p → q) only implies that if p is true, then q must be true. It does not imply that if q is true, then p must be true. Additionally, there could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that affirming the consequent is not a valid inference in this case. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Tom watched football' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
