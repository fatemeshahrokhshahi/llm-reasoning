However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - If we affirm the consequent, we are assuming that 'Sue was at the wedding' is true. However, this does not provide any information about whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that the conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' only implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. It does not imply that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. Additionally, there could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, such as she was a bridesmaid or a friend of the bride.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we see that it is not. The conditional statement and the consequent affirmation do not provide enough information to infer that 'Mary was at the wedding'. This is a fundamental logical fallacy, and we should not assume that affirming the consequent is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
