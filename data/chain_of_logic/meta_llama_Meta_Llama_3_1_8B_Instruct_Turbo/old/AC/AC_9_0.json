However, this does not necessarily imply that the antecedent (p) is true.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid. In this case, affirming the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) does not necessarily imply that the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes, we see that the conditional statement only implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. It does not imply that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we conclude that it is not valid. Affirming the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) does not entail that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
