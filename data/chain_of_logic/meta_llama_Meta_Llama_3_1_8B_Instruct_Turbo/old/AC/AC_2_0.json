However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - If we affirm the consequent, we are assuming that 'The unicorn was in the forest' is true. However, this does not provide any information about the griffin's location.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If A, then B' only implies that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not imply that if B is true, then A must be true. In this case, the unicorn's presence in the forest does not necessarily mean that the griffin was also present.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since affirming the consequent is a fundamental logical fallacy, we cannot infer that 'The griffin was in the forest' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
