  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims. We have the following statements:\n- Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US.\n- Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n- If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.\n- Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the statements into elements:\n- Probabilities: Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, Georgia likely won’t, and Missouri’s growth is significantly lower.\n- Nested conditionals: If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.\n- The question: Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statements:\n- We have a conditional statement: If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.\n- We also have a probability claim: Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals:\n- The conditional statement involves a nested structure, which creates a probability distribution problem.\n- The probability claim about Tennessee and Georgia doesn’t directly support the likelihood of Missouri’s growth.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario:\n- The conditional statement creates a dependency between Georgia and Tennessee’s growth.\n- However, the probability claim about Tennessee and Georgia doesn’t provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Missouri’s growth.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if the Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid:\n- The inference involves a probability claim and a nested conditional structure.\n- The probability claim about Tennessee and Georgia doesn’t directly support the likelihood of Missouri’s growth, making the inference invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
