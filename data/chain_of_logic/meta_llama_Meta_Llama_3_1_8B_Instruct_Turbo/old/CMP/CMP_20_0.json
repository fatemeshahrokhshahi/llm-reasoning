  "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims. We have the following information:\n- Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers.\n- Tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n- If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n- These are the only major morning drinks.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the information into elements:\n- Probabilities: Coffee likely retains the most morning drinkers, and tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n- Nested conditionals: If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n- The question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given information:\n- We have p (coffee likely retains the most morning drinkers) and q (tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers).\n- We also have the conditional statement: If ¬q (tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers), then if ¬p (coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers), r (soda will retain the most morning drinkers).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals:\n- We know p is likely, and hence q is likely (since tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers).\n- However, the conditional statement involves ¬q (tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers), which is not likely.\n- Therefore, the conditional statement is not likely to be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario:\n- The conditional statement involves a low-probability outcome (tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers).\n- Even if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, the probability of soda retaining the most morning drinkers is still low.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if the Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid:\n- The inference breaks down because the nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem.\n- The likelihood of the conditional statement is low, and hence the conclusion is not likely.\n\nAnswer: no"
