  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims. We have three candidates (Priya, Julian, and Diego) and their likelihoods of getting the management position. The conditionals are: if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will (Julian → (Priya → Diego)). It's also given that it's likely Priya will get the offer and hence that Julian won’t (Priya → ~Julian).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - We break down the question into elements: probabilities, nested conditionals, and the question. The probabilities are: Priya is likely to get the offer, Julian is the second most likely, and Diego is a longshot. The nested conditionals are: Julian → (Priya → Diego) and Priya → ~Julian.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - We analyze the given conditionals and probabilities. If Priya → ~Julian is likely, this means that Priya getting the offer makes it likely that Julian won't. However, this doesn't directly tell us about the likelihood of Diego getting the offer if Priya doesn't.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We check if the likelihood transfers through the nested conditionals. The question asks if it's likely that if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will. We need to consider the probability distribution in the conditional scenario.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We analyze the probability distribution in the conditional scenario. The conditional Julian → (Priya → Diego) creates a problem. Even if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego might still not get the offer if Julian gets it instead. This means that the likelihood of Diego getting the offer if Priya doesn't depends on the probability of Julian getting the offer.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - We determine if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid. The inference breaks down because the nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem. The likelihood of Diego getting the offer if Priya doesn't depends on the probability of Julian getting the offer, which is not given. Therefore, it does not follow that it is likely that if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will.\n\nAnswer: no"
