  "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

      "content": "Explanation:\n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims. We have three new laws: minimum wage hike (p), paid family leave (q), and student loan forgiveness (r). The probability of each law is given: p is likely, q is less likely than p, and r is the least likely. We also have two conditional statements: if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen (q¬ → (p¬ → r)); and a minimum wage hike likely will happen, hence paid leave likely won't happen (p → q¬).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - We break down the problem into elements: probabilities (p, q, r), nested conditionals (q¬ → (p¬ → r), p → q¬), and the question (does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - We analyze the given conditionals and probabilities. The first conditional statement (q¬ → (p¬ → r)) implies that if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. However, the second conditional statement (p → q¬) implies that a minimum wage hike likely will happen, hence paid leave likely won't happen.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We check if the likelihood transfers through the nested conditionals. The question is whether it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will. We need to determine if the likelihood of p¬ (minimum wage hike doesn't happen) and r (loan forgiveness) is high.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We analyze the probability distribution in the conditional scenario. The given probabilities are: p is likely, q is less likely than p, and r is the least likely. However, the conditional statements create a probability distribution problem. The first conditional statement (q¬ → (p¬ → r)) implies that if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. This means that the probability of r (loan forgiveness) is high if p¬ (minimum wage hike doesn't happen) and q¬ (paid leave doesn't happen) are both true. However, the second conditional statement (p → q¬) implies that a minimum wage hike likely will happen, hence paid leave likely won't happen. This means that the probability of q¬ (paid leave doesn't happen) is low if p (minimum wage hike) is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - We determine if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid. The given conditionals and probabilities create a probability distribution problem. The likelihood of p¬ (minimum wage hike doesn't happen) and r (loan forgiveness) is not high because the probability of q¬ (paid leave doesn't happen) is low if p (minimum wage hike) is true. Therefore, it does not follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will.\n\nAnswer: no"
