The question is whether we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: Lisa bought the red shirt\n- B: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B, where A → B is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and A is 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We know that A is true (Lisa bought the red shirt). The conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Since A is true and the conditional rule states that if A is true, then B must be true, we can infer that B is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
