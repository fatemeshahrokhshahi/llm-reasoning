The question is whether we can infer 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Break down the conditional rule into elements (A, B). \n- A: 'The apple was red'\n- B: 'The banana was yellow'\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Write the logical form (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?\n- The conditional rule is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', which translates to (A → B).\n- The premise 'The apple was red' translates to A.\n- The question is whether we can infer 'The banana was yellow', which translates to B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Check if the antecedent A is true, and what the conditional tells us.\n- The premise 'The apple was red' is true (A is true).\n- The conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combine the answers to evaluate the logic.\n- Since A is true, and the conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B must be true, we can conclude that B is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Apply Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion.\n- (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B (Modus Ponens rule)\n- Therefore, we can infer 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
