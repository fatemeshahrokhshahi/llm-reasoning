      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' and 'Tom watched football'. The question is whether we can infer 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: Tom watched football\n- B: Jen watched basketball\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true, we have 'Tom watched football', which is true. The conditional tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can infer that since Tom watched football and the conditional states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can infer that 'Jen watched basketball' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
