      "content": "Explanation: \n- The question is asking if we can infer 'Lucy went to the zoo' from two premises: 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Joe went to the park'.\n- We need to break down the conditional rule into elements (A, B): \n  - A: 'Joe went to the park'\n  - B: 'Lucy went to the zoo'\n- The logical form is: (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B\n- We need to check if the antecedent A is true and what the conditional tells us.\n- The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n- Since we know that A is true ('Joe went to the park'), we can apply the Modus Ponens rule.\n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Joe went to the park'. The question is asking if we can infer 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - \n- A: 'Joe went to the park'\n- B: 'Lucy went to the zoo'\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - \n- The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n- We know that A is true ('Joe went to the park').\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - \n- Since A is true, we can apply the Modus Ponens rule.\n- The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - \n- We can infer that B is true, which means 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
