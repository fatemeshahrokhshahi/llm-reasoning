The question is whether we can infer 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: Sue chose pizza\n- B: Bob chose pasta\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we get: (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta) ∧ Sue chose pizza ⊢ Bob chose pasta?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A (Sue chose pizza) is true, and what the conditional tells us. The conditional states that if A (Sue chose pizza) is true, then B (Bob chose pasta) must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we know that A (Sue chose pizza) is true, and the conditional tells us that if A is true, then B (Bob chose pasta) must be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion, we can infer that B (Bob chose pasta) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
