The question is whether we can infer 'The wolf was in the den'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: The bear was in the cave\n- B: The wolf was in the den\n- The conditional rule is: If A, then B (A → B)\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We have two premises: \n- A → B (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den)\n- A (The bear was in the cave)\nWe need to check if the antecedent A is true, and what the conditional tells us.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Since A is true (The bear was in the cave), and the conditional rule A → B tells us that if A is true, then B must be true, we can infer that B is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B is true, which means 'The wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
