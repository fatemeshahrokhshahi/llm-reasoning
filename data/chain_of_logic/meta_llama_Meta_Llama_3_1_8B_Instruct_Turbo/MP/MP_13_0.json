The question is whether we can infer 'The truck was blue'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: 'The car was red'\n- B: 'The truck was blue'\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we get:\n(A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true, we see that 'The car was red' is indeed true. The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can infer that since A is true and the conditional tells us that A implies B, then B must be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that 'The truck was blue' is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
