The question is whether we can infer 'The truck was metal'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: The doll was plastic\n- B: The truck was metal\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true, we see that 'The doll was plastic' is indeed true. The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can see that the antecedent A is true, and the conditional rule states that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B (The truck was metal) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
