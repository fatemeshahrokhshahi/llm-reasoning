The question is whether we can infer 'Erin took a train'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'Sam took a plane' and B = 'Erin took a train'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B, where A → B means 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and A means 'Sam took a plane'.\nStep 4: Question Answering - We know that A is true ('Sam took a plane'). The conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B must be true ('Erin took a train').\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Since A is true and the conditional rule states that if A is true, then B must be true, we can infer that B is true.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B ('Erin took a train') is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
