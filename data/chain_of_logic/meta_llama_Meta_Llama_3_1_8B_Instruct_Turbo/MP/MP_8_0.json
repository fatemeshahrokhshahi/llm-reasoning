The question is whether we can infer 'The mummy was awake'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'The vampire was awake' and B = 'The mummy was awake'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B, where A → B means 'If A, then B' and A is 'The vampire was awake'.\nStep 4: Question Answering - We know that the antecedent A ('The vampire was awake') is true. The conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B ('The mummy was awake') must also be true.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Since A is true and the conditional rule states that if A is true, then B must be true, we can conclude that B is also true.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can infer that 'The mummy was awake' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
