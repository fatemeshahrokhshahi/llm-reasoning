      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' and 'Ben ate pasta'. The question is whether we can infer 'Kate ate the salad'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Break down the conditional rule into elements (A, B). Here, A is 'Ben ate pasta' and B is 'Kate ate the salad'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Write the logical form (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B? This translates to 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' and 'Ben ate pasta' implies 'Kate ate the salad'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Check if the antecedent A is true, and what the conditional tells us. In this case, A is 'Ben ate pasta', which is true. The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combine the answers to evaluate the logic. Since A is true and the conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must be true, we can infer that B is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Apply Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion. Since we have (A → B) ∧ A, we can apply Modus Ponens to conclude that B is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
