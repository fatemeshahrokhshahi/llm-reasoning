We're asked to infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B = 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The contrapositive is 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we can infer that 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' is a valid conclusion from the original statement.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The logical transformation is correct, as contraposition is a fundamental law of logic.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is indeed valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
