We're asked to infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the car was red' and B = 'the truck was blue'. The contrapositive is ¬B → ¬A.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we can infer that 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' is logically equivalent to the original statement.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The logical transformation is correct, as contraposition is a fundamental law of logic.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
