We're asked to infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Joe went to the park' and B = 'Lucy went to the zoo'. The contrapositive is ¬B → ¬A.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original statement is (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we can infer that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The contrapositive ¬B → ¬A is logically equivalent to the original statement A → B, so we can conclude that the inference is valid.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is correct.\n\nAnswer: yes"
