We're asked to infer 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the dog was inside' and B = 'the cat was outside'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we can infer that 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside' is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The logical transformation is correct, as contraposition is a fundamental law of logic.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is indeed valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
