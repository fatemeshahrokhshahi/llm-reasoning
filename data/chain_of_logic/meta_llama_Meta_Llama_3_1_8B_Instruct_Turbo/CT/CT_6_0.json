The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we can infer that 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' is a valid conclusion.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The logical transformation is correct, as contraposition is a fundamental law of logic.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is indeed valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
