Therefore, we can infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The logical transformation is correct, as contraposition is a fundamental law of logic.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
