We're asked to infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'the shirt was cotton' and B = 'the pants were denim'. The contrapositive is ¬B → ¬A.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we can infer that if the pants were not denim (¬B), then the shirt was not cotton (¬A).\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation is correct, we see that the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can confidently infer that 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
