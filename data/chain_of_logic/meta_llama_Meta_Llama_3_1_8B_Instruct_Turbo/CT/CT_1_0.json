We're asked to infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Mary was at the wedding' and B = 'Sue was at the wedding'. The contrapositive is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we can infer that 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' is logically equivalent to the original statement.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The logical transformation is correct, as contraposition is a fundamental law of logic.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
