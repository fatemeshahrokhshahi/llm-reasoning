Therefore, the modal possibility (♢¬B) does not eliminate the possibility of the toy being in the toy box.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this Disjunctive Syllogism with modals is valid\n- Since the modal possibility (♢¬B) does not eliminate the possibility of the toy being in the toy box, we cannot infer that the toy is in the toy box from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
