It only allows for the possibility that they are not perched on her head, but does not rule out the possibility that they are in her bag.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this Disjunctive Syllogism with modals is valid\n- Since the modal possibility does not eliminate the disjunctive option, we cannot infer that the sunglasses are in her bag from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
