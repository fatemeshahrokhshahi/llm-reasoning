      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. We're asked to infer 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'the apple was red' and B = 'the banana was yellow'. The inverse would be ¬A = 'the apple was not red' and ¬B = 'the banana was not yellow'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color when the apple is not red. It only states that if the apple is red, the banana is yellow.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that the banana could still be yellow even if the apple is not red. This is because the original statement does not establish a causal relationship between the two events.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that it is. The original statement does not imply the inverse, and the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original.\n\nAnswer: no"
