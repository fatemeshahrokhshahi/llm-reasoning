      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. We're asked to infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A: 'the dog was inside' and B: 'the cat was outside'. The inverse would be ¬A: 'the dog was not inside' and ¬B: 'the cat was inside'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original conditional is (A → B). We're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its inverse. The original statement does not imply that if the dog is not inside, the cat must be inside.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Even if the dog is not inside, the cat could still be outside. The cat's location is not dependent on the dog's location in this scenario.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, which is invalid. The original conditional does not imply the inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
