We're asked to infer 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'Joe went to the park' and B = 'Lucy went to the zoo'. The inverse would be ¬A = 'Joe did not go to the park' and ¬B = 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what Lucy did when Joe did not go to the park. It only tells us that when Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can consider a scenario where Joe did not go to the park, but Lucy still went to the zoo for some other reason. This shows that B (Lucy went to the zoo) does not necessarily depend on A (Joe went to the park).\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that the original statement does not logically imply the inverse. The original statement does not provide any information about what Lucy did when Joe did not go to the park, and B could still be true even when A is false.\n\nAnswer: no"
