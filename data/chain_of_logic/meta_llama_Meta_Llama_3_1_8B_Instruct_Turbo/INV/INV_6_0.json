The inverse would be ¬A = 'Sue did not choose pizza' and ¬B = 'Bob did not choose pasta'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original conditional is (A → B), and we're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza. It only talks about the relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that Bob could still have chosen pasta even if Sue did not choose pizza. This is because the original statement does not establish a causal relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that the original statement does not logically entail the inverse. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no"
