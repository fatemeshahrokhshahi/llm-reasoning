      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. We're asked to infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'Tom watched football' and B = 'Jen watched basketball'. The inverse would be ¬A = 'Tom did not watch football' and ¬B = 'Jen did not watch basketball'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original conditional is (A → B). We're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football. It only states the relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that Jen could still be watching basketball even if Tom did not watch football. This is because the original statement does not imply a causal relationship between Tom's actions and Jen's actions.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that the original statement does not entail the inverse. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no"
