We're asked to infer 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'the bear was in the cave' and B = 'the wolf was in the den'. The inverse of the original conditional is 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the bear and the wolf when the bear is not in the cave. It only states that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that the wolf could still be in the den even if the bear is not in the cave. This is because the original statement does not establish a direct causal relationship between the bear's presence in the cave and the wolf's presence in the den.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we conclude that it is. The original conditional statement does not imply the inverse, and the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original.\n\nAnswer: no"
