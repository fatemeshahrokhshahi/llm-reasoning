We're asked to infer 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'Sam took a plane' and B = 'Erin took a train'. The inverse would be ¬A = 'Sam did not take a plane' and ¬B = 'Erin did not take a train'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane. It only states the consequence of Sam taking a plane.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we realize that Erin could still take a train even if Sam did not take a plane. There's no logical connection between Sam's mode of transportation and Erin's.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that the original statement does not entail the inverse. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original, and we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
