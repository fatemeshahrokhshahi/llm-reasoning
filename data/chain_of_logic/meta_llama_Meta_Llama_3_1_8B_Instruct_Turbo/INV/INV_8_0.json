We're asked to infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'the vampire was awake' and B = 'the mummy was awake'. The inverse of the original conditional is 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original conditional does not provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake. It only talks about the relationship between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness when the vampire is awake.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can consider a scenario where the mummy is awake even when the vampire is not. This is possible if there's another reason for the mummy's wakefulness that is independent of the vampire's state.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that the original conditional does not logically entail the inverse. The original conditional only provides a relationship between the vampire's and mummy's wakefulness when the vampire is awake, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
