We're asked to infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B = 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The inverse of the original conditional is 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original conditional is (A → B). We're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its inverse. The truth of the original conditional does not guarantee the truth of the inverse.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, Mark could still have bought the blue shirt for other reasons. This means B could still be true even when A is false.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original conditional does not entail its inverse, this is an example of the \"Inversion\" FALLACY.\n\nAnswer: no"
