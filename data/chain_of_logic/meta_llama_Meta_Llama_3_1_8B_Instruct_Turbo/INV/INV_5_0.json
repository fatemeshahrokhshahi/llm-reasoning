We're asked to infer 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Jeff played basketball' and B = 'Amy played tennis'. The inverse would be ¬A = 'Jeff did not play basketball' and ¬B = 'Amy did not play tennis'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original conditional is (A → B). We're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Jeff does not play basketball. It only states the relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that Amy could still play tennis even if Jeff does not play basketball. This is because the original statement does not establish a causal relationship between Jeff's basketball playing and Amy's tennis playing.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that the original statement does not logically entail the inverse. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Jeff does not play basketball, and Amy could still play tennis in that case.\n\nAnswer: no"
