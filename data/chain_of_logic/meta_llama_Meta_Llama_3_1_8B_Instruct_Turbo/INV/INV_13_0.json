We're asked to infer 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A: 'the car was red' and B: 'the truck was blue'. The inverse would be ¬A: 'the car was not red' and ¬B: 'the truck was not blue'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original conditional is (A → B). We're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the car's color and the truck's color when the car is not red.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can consider a scenario where the car is not red, but the truck is still blue. This is possible, as the original statement only establishes a relationship between the car's color and the truck's color when the car is red, not when it's not red.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original statement does not imply that the truck's color is dependent on the car's color when the car is not red, we cannot infer that 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue'.\n\nAnswer: no"
