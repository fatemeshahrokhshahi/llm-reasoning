We're asked to infer 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A: 'the book was written by James' and B: 'the book is a mystery novel'. The inverse of the original statement would be 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when A is false. It only talks about the relationship between A and B when A is true.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we realize that the original statement does not rule out the possibility of the book being a mystery novel even if it was not written by James. There could be other authors who wrote mystery novels.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we conclude that it is. The original statement does not imply the inverse, and this is a fundamental logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
