We're asked to infer 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A: 'the alien visited Mars' and B: 'the robot visited Jupiter'. The inverse of the original conditional is 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we get (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we need to see if the truth of the original conditional guarantees the truth of its inverse. However, the original conditional does not provide any information about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can see that the robot could still visit Jupiter even if the alien did not visit Mars. This is because the original conditional only establishes a relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter, but it does not imply that the robot's visit to Jupiter is dependent on the alien's visit to Mars.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we can see that the original conditional does not entail its inverse. This is because the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original, and the original conditional does not provide any information about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: no"
