We're asked to infer 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Alex finished the race' and B = 'Chris finished the face'. The inverse of the original conditional is 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the face'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original conditional is (A → B). We're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its inverse. The original statement only guarantees that if Alex finishes the race, Chris finishes the face, but it does not guarantee that if Alex doesn't finish the race, Chris also doesn't finish the face.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Even if Alex didn't finish the race, it's possible that Chris still finished the face for some other reason. This means B could still be true even when A is false.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original conditional does not guarantee the inverse, this is an example of the \"Inversion\" FALLACY.\n\nAnswer: no"
