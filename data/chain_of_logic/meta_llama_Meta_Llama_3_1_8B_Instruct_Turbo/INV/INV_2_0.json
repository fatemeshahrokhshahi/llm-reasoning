We're asked to infer 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'the griffin was in the forest' and B = 'the unicorn was in the forest'. The inverse of the original conditional is 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about the unicorn's presence when the griffin is not in the forest. It only states that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is in the forest.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can consider a scenario where the unicorn is in the forest but the griffin is not. This is a possible scenario, as the original statement does not imply that the unicorn's presence is dependent on the griffin's presence.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that the original conditional does not logically entail the inverse. The original statement does not provide enough information to prove the inverse, and there are possible scenarios where the unicorn is in the forest even if the griffin is not.\n\nAnswer: no"
