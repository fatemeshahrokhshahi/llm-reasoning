We're asked to infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A = 'Mary was at the wedding' and B = 'Sue was at the wedding'. The inverse would be ¬A = 'Mary was not at the wedding' and ¬B = 'Sue was not at the wedding'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form: (A → B) → (¬A → ¬B)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. It only tells us that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue is also at the wedding.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we can consider a scenario where Mary is not at the wedding, but Sue is still at the wedding. This is possible, as there could be other reasons why Sue attended the wedding that are unrelated to Mary's presence.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that the original conditional does not logically entail the inverse. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding, and it is possible for Sue to be at the wedding even if Mary is not.\n\nAnswer: no"
