The inverse would be ¬A = 'Ben did not eat pasta' and ¬B = 'Kate did not eat salad'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original conditional is (A → B), and we're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what Kate ate when Ben did not eat pasta.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we realize that Kate could still have eaten salad even if Ben did not eat pasta. This is a critical point, as it shows that the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" FALLACY, we see that it is indeed a case of the invalid inversion fallacy. The original statement does not imply the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
