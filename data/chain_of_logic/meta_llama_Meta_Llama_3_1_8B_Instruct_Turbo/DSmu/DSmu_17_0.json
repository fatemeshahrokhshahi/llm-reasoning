However, we know from the critical rule that disjunctive syllogism with 'must' is invalid.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that 'not necessarily B' (¬□B) does not imply 'not B' (¬B). This is because modal uncertainty allows both options to remain open.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that disjunctive syllogism with 'must' is invalid, we cannot infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
