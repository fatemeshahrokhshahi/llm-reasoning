However, we know from the critical rule that disjunctive syllogism with 'must' is invalid.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that 'not necessarily B' does not imply 'not B'. The modal uncertainty allows both options to remain open.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the critical rule that disjunctive syllogism with 'must' is invalid, we cannot infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
