This is because \"not necessarily B\" does not imply \"not B\". Modal uncertainty allows both options to remain open.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the disjunctive syllogism with 'must' is invalid, we cannot infer A (the missing sock is in the laundry basket) from (A ∨ □B) ∧ ¬□B.\n\nAnswer: no"
