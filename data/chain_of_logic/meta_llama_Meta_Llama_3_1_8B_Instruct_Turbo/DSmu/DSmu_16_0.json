We need to identify the disjunction and modal statements.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the disjunction (A ∨ □B) and modal necessity (¬□B), we have two separate statements: A (the pen is in my bag) and □B (the pen must be on my desk).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (A ∨ □B) ∧ ¬□B, we are trying to determine if it logically follows that A (the pen is in my bag).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity (¬□B) supports the disjunctive syllogism (A ∨ □B) ∧ ¬□B ⊢ A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk' (¬□B) does not necessarily imply 'The pen is not on my desk' (¬B). This is because 'not necessarily' leaves room for the possibility that the pen is on the desk, even if it's not a necessity.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that the disjunctive syllogism with 'must' is invalid, we cannot infer that 'The pen is in my bag' (A) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
