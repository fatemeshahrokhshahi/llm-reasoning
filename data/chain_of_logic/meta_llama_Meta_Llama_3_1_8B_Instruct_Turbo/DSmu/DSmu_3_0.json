The negation of this modal statement (¬□B) only affects the necessity of B, not the possibility of B.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this Disjunctive Syllogism with 'must' is valid\n- Since \"not necessarily B\" does not imply \"not B\", we cannot infer A (the keys are in the drawer) from (A ∨ □B) ∧ ¬□B.\n\nAnswer: no"
