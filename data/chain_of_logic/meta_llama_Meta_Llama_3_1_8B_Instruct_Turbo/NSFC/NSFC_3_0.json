The proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between ♢(p ∨ q) and ♢p ∧ ♢q, we need to determine if the former logically entails the latter.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - In natural language, 'Might (A or B)' often implies 'Might A and might B', which suggests that the narrow-scope free choice inference is valid.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we find that the free choice semantics supports both options being genuinely available. This is a common interpretation in practical reasoning.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, the narrow-scope free choice inference is valid, and we can infer 'The cat might be on the roof and the cat might be in the garden' from 'The cat might be on the roof or in the garden'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
