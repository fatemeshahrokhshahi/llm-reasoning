The proposed inference 'The train might be early and the train might be late' can be represented as ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between ♢(p ∨ q) and ♢p ∧ ♢q, we need to determine if ♢(p ∨ q) logically entails ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - In this case, we are testing the validity of narrow-scope free choice, which is a common inference in natural language.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we find that in natural language, 'Might (A or B)' often implies 'Might A and might B'. This is an example of \"Free Choice\" semantics, where both options are genuinely available.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the CRITICAL RULE that narrow-scope free choice is valid in natural language, we can conclude that the inference 'The train might be early and the train might be late' is indeed valid from 'The train might be early or late'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
