The proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between ♢(p ∨ q) and ♢p ∧ ♢q, we need to determine if the former logically entails the latter.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - In natural language, 'Might (A or B)' often implies 'Might A and might B', which suggests that the narrow-scope free choice inference is valid.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we see that both options (cleaning the room and going to the lecture) are genuinely available, which supports the narrow-scope free choice inference.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, the narrow-scope free choice inference is valid, which means we can infer 'John might clean his room and John might go to the lecture' from 'John might clean his room or go to the lecture'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
