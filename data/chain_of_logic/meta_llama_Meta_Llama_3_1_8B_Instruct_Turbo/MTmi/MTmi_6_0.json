The modal possibility statement is 'Bob might not have chosen pasta', which can be written as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement p → □q, we get that if p is true, then q must be true. The modal possibility statement ♢¬q means that it is possible that q is not true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - We are analyzing the validity of the inference (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q ⊢ ¬p. This means we are checking if the conjunction of the conditional statement and the modal possibility statement logically implies the negation of p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal possibility contradicts the modal necessity. However, the modal possibility ♢¬q does not necessarily contradict the modal necessity □q. The possibility of q not being true does not necessarily mean that q is not true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We need to distinguish between \"might not\" and \"not\" in modal contexts. The statement ♢¬q expresses possibility, not definitive negation. This means that it is possible that q is not true, but it does not mean that q is not true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - We are determining if the Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is valid. However, as per the critical rule, the Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is invalid. This means that we cannot infer ¬p from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
