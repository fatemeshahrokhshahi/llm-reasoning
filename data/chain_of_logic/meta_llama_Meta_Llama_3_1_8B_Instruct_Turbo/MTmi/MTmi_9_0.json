      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt', which can be written as p → □q, where p is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The modal possibility statement is 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt', which can be written as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement p → □q, we get if p then q is necessary. Breaking down the modal possibility statement ♢¬q, we get q is not necessary.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we are trying to determine if it logically follows that ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal possibility (♢¬q) contradicts the modal necessity (□q). However, the modal possibility (♢¬q) only expresses that q is not necessary, not that q is false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Distinguishing \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts, we see that ♢¬q expresses a possibility, not a definitive negation. This is different from the classic Modus Tollens, where ¬q is a definitive negation.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the modal possibility (♢¬q) does not contradict the modal necessity (□q), we cannot infer that ¬p from (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q.\n\nAnswer: no"
