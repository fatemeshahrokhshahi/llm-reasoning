The modal possibility is ♢¬q (the banana might not have been yellow).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - We need to analyze if (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q ⊢ ¬p. This is a modal version of Modus Tollens, but with \"might not\" instead of \"not must\".\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal possibility contradicts the modal necessity. However, \"might not\" expresses possibility, not definitive negation.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We need to distinguish \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts. \"Might not\" does not necessarily mean the opposite of \"must\", but rather that it is possible for the opposite to be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since \"might not\" expresses possibility, not definitive negation, the modal version of Modus Tollens with \"might\" is invalid. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The apple was not red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
