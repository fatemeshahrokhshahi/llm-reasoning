      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding', which can be represented as p → □q, where p is 'Mary was at the wedding' and q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The modal possibility is 'Sue might not have been at the wedding', which can be represented as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement p → □q, we get that if p is true, then q must be true. The modal possibility ♢¬q means that it is possible that q is not true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we are trying to determine if it logically follows that ¬p (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal possibility (♢¬q) contradicts the modal necessity (□q). However, the modal possibility does not necessarily contradict the modal necessity, as the possibility of q not being true does not necessarily mean that q is not true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Distinguishing \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts, we see that \"might not\" expresses possibility, not definitive negation. Therefore, the possibility of Sue not being at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Sue is not at the wedding.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is valid, we see that it is not valid. The classic Modus Tollens and the Modal version with \"not must\" are valid, but the Modal version with \"might not\" is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
