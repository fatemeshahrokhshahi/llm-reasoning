The modal possibility statement is 'Kate might not have eaten salad', which can be written as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement p → □q, we get that if p is true, then q must be true. The modal possibility statement ♢¬q means that it is possible that q is not true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we are trying to determine if it logically follows that ¬p (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal possibility (♢¬q) contradicts the modal necessity (□q). However, the possibility of Kate not eating salad does not necessarily contradict the necessity of Kate eating salad if Ben ate pasta.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Distinguishing \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts, we see that \"might not\" expresses possibility, not definitive negation. Therefore, the possibility of Kate not eating salad does not necessarily mean that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the modal possibility does not contradict the modal necessity, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
