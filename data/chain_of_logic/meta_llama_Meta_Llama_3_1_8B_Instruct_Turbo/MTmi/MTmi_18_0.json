      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'the doll was plastic' and 'q' is 'the truck was metal'. The modal possibility statement is 'The truck might not have been metal', which can be written as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement 'p → □q' and the modal possibility statement ♢¬q. The conditional statement implies that if 'p' is true, then 'q' must be true. The modal possibility statement implies that 'q' might not be true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression: (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q. This expression combines the conditional statement and the modal possibility statement.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if the modal possibility contradicts the modal necessity. The modal possibility statement ♢¬q does not necessarily contradict the modal necessity statement □q, because 'might not' expresses possibility, not definitive negation.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Distinguishing 'might not' from 'not' in modal contexts. The statement 'The truck might not have been metal' does not imply that the truck was not metal; it only implies that it is possible that the truck was not metal.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is valid. Since 'might not' expresses possibility, not definitive negation, the Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
