The modal possibility statement is 'Amy might not have played tennis', which can be written as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement p → □q, we get that if p is true, then q must be true. The modal possibility statement ♢¬q means that it is possible that q is not true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we are trying to determine if it logically follows that ¬p (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal possibility (♢¬q) contradicts the modal necessity (□q). However, the modal possibility only expresses a possibility, not a definitive negation.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Distinguishing \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts, we see that \"might not\" expresses a possibility, not a definitive negation. This is critical in understanding the modal context.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the critical rule that Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is invalid, we can conclude that the statement (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q does not logically follow that ¬p (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nAnswer: no"
