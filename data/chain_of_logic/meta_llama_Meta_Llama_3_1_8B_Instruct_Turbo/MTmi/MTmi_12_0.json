      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo', which can be represented as p → □q, where p is 'Joe went to the park' and q is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. The modal possibility is 'Lucy might not have gone to the zoo', which can be represented as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p → □q and ♢¬q. The first statement implies that if p is true, then q must be true. The second statement implies that q might not be true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statement (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we need to determine if it logically follows that ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal possibility (♢¬q) contradicts the modal necessity (□q). However, 'might not' expresses possibility, not definitive negation, which is a critical distinction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Distinguishing 'might not' from 'not' in modal contexts, we see that 'might not' does not necessarily imply the negation of the statement. Therefore, the possibility of Lucy not going to the zoo does not necessarily contradict the necessity of her going to the zoo if Joe went to the park.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that the modal version with 'might not' is invalid, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
