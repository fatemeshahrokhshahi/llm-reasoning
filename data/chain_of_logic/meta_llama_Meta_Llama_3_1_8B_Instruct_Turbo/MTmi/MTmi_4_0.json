The modal possibility statement is 'The robot might not have visited Jupiter', which can be written as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement p → □q, we get if p then q is necessary (□q). Breaking down the modal possibility statement ♢¬q, we get q is not necessary (¬□q), but q is possible (♢q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we are trying to determine if it logically follows that ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal possibility (♢¬q) contradicts the modal necessity (□q). However, the possibility of q not being true does not necessarily contradict the necessity of q being true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We need to distinguish between \"might not\" and \"not\" in modal contexts. \"Might not\" expresses possibility, not definitive negation. Therefore, ♢¬q does not necessarily mean that q is not true, but rather that it is possible that q is not true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the modal possibility (♢¬q) does not necessarily contradict the modal necessity (□q), we cannot infer that ¬p. The modal modus tollens with 'might' is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
