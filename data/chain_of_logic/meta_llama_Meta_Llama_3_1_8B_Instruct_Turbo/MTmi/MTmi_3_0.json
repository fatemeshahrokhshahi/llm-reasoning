      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel', which can be represented as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'the book was written by James' and 'q' is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The modal possibility statement is 'The book might not be a mystery novel', which can be represented as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement 'p → □q' and the modal possibility statement ♢¬q. The conditional statement implies that if 'p' is true, then 'q' must be true. The modal possibility statement implies that 'q' might not be true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression: Does (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q ⊢ ¬p? This expression represents the combination of the conditional statement and the modal possibility statement, and asks if it logically follows that 'p' is not true.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if the modal possibility contradicts the modal necessity. The modal possibility statement ♢¬q does not necessarily contradict the modal necessity statement □q, because 'might not' expresses a possibility, not a definitive negation.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Distinguishing 'might not' from 'not' in modal contexts. The statement 'The book might not be a mystery novel' expresses a possibility, not a definitive negation. This is different from the statement 'The book is not a mystery novel', which would express a definitive negation.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if the Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is valid. The Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is invalid, as explained in the critical rule. This means that we cannot logically infer 'The book was not written by James' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
