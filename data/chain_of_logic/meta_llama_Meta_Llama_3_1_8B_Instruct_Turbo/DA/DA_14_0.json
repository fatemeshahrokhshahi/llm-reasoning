      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' and 'The bear was not in the cave'. The question is whether we can infer 'The wolf was not in the den'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'The bear was in the cave' and B = 'The wolf was in the den'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A. We want to determine if this entails ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (the bear was not in the cave) does not directly allow us to conclude B is false (the wolf was not in the den). We need to consider other possibilities.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways B could be true without A. For instance, the wolf could have been in the den even if the bear was not in the cave. Perhaps the wolf was in the den because it was its usual habitat, or because it was attracted to something else in the den.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since B could be true for many other reasons besides A, we cannot infer ¬B from (A → B) ∧ ¬A. This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
