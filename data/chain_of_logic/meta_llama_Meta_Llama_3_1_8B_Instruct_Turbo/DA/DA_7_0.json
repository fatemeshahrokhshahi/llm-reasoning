      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have two premises: \n- If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (A → B)\n- Alex did not finish the race (¬A)\nWe are asked to infer if Chris did not finish the race (¬B).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements (A, B):\n- A: Alex finished the race\n- B: Chris finished the race\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false:\n- Knowing A is false (¬A) does not directly imply that B is false (¬B).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A:\n- B (Chris finished the race) could be true for many other reasons besides A (Alex finishing the race). For instance, Chris might have finished the race on his own, or someone else might have finished it for him.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY:\n- Yes, this is a case of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, which is invalid. We cannot conclude that Chris did not finish the race (¬B) based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
