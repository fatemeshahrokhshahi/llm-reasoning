      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' and 'The vampire was not awake'. The question is whether we can infer 'The mummy was not awake'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let A be 'the vampire was awake' and B be 'the mummy was awake'. The conditional rule is A → B, and we have ¬A.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B.\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (¬A) does not allow us to conclude B is false (¬B) because there could be other reasons for B to be true.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The mummy could be awake for many other reasons, such as the mummy being naturally awake or the mummy being awakened by something else. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the mummy was not awake.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, which is invalid. We cannot infer ¬B from (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nAnswer: no"
