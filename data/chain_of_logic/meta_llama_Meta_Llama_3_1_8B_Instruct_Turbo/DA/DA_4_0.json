The question is whether we can infer 'The robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements: \n- A: The alien visited Mars\n- B: The robot visited Jupiter\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A is 'The alien visited Mars' and B is 'The robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (¬A) does not allow us to conclude B is false. We cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter just because the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways B could be true without A. The robot could have visited Jupiter for many other reasons, such as being sent by a different spacecraft or being programmed to visit Jupiter on its own.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY. The premises do not logically entail the conclusion that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no"
