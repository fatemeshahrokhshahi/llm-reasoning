The question is whether we can infer 'Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'Tom watched football' and B = 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A → B means 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' and ¬A means 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (Tom did not watch football) allows us to conclude B is false (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We need to analyze if there are other ways B could be true without A. In this case, there are many other reasons why Jen could have watched basketball, such as she might have watched it alone, or with someone else, or at a different time, etc. The fact that Tom did not watch football does not necessarily imply that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we cannot conclude that Jen did not watch basketball solely based on the fact that Tom did not watch football, this is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY.\n\nAnswer: no"
