The question is whether we can infer 'Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'Jeff played basketball' and B = 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A → B is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' and ¬A is 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (Jeff did not play basketball) allows us to conclude B is false (Amy did not play tennis).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We need to analyze if there are other ways B could be true without A. In this case, there are many other reasons why Amy could have played tennis, such as she might have played tennis for her own reasons, or she might have played tennis with someone else, or she might have played tennis at a different time. The fact that Jeff did not play basketball does not necessarily imply that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since there are other ways B could be true without A, we cannot conclude that Amy did not play tennis just because Jeff did not play basketball. This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
