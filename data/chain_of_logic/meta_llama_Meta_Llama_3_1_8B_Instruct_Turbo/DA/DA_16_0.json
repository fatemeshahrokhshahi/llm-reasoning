The question is whether we can infer 'The pants were not denim'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The shirt was cotton' and B = 'The pants were denim'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A is 'The shirt was cotton' and B is 'The pants were denim'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (¬A) does not allow us to conclude B is false (¬B) because the truth of B is not dependent on A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways B could be true without A. For instance, the pants could be denim regardless of the material of the shirt.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY. The premises do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no"
