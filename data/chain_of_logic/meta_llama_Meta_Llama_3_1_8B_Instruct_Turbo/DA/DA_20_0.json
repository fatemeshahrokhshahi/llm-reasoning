      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The apple was not red'. The question is whether we can infer 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'The apple was red', B = 'The banana was yellow'. The conditional rule is A → B.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A. We want to know if this entails ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (¬A) does not allow us to conclude B is false (¬B). We cannot infer the color of the banana from the fact that the apple is not red.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways the banana could be yellow without the apple being red. For example, the banana could be yellow due to its natural color or other environmental factors.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY. We cannot infer that the banana was not yellow from the fact that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no"
