      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' and 'Mary was not at the wedding'. The question is whether we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Mary was at the wedding' and B = 'Sue was at the wedding'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B, where A → B is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' and ¬A is 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (Mary was not at the wedding) does not allow us to conclude B is false (Sue was not at the wedding) because there could be other reasons for Sue to be at the wedding.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways B could be true without A. For instance, Sue could have been at the wedding for her own reasons, such as being a close friend of the groom or being part of the wedding party.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY. We cannot infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
