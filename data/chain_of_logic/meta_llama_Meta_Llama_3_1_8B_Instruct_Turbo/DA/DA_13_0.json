      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' and 'The car was not red'. The question is whether we can infer 'The truck was not blue'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'The car was red', B = 'The truck was blue'. The rule is A → B, and we also have ¬A.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?. This is the form we need to analyze.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (¬A) does not allow us to conclude B is false (¬B). We cannot infer that the truck was not blue just because the car was not red.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways B could be true without A. For example, the truck could be blue regardless of the color of the car. The color of the car does not determine the color of the truck.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY. We cannot infer that the truck was not blue from the given premises. The conclusion 'The truck was not blue' is not logically entailed by the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
