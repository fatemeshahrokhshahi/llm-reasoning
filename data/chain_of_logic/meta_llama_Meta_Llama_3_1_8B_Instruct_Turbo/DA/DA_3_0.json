      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' and 'The book was not written by James'. The question is whether we can infer 'The book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: The book was written by James.\n- B: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A is 'The book was written by James' and B is 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (¬A) does not allow us to conclude B is false. We cannot directly infer that the book is not a mystery novel just because it was not written by James.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways the book could be a mystery novel without being written by James. For example, it could have been written by another author who also writes mystery novels.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY. We cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
