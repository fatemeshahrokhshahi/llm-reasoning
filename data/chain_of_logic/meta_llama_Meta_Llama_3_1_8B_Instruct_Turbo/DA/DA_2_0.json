The question is whether we can infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The griffin was in the forest' and B = 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (¬A) does not allow us to conclude B is false (¬B) because there could be other reasons for B to be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we can see that the unicorn could be in the forest for many reasons unrelated to the griffin's presence. For example, the unicorn might be there for a different reason, or it might be in a different part of the forest.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we cannot conclude that B is false (¬B) solely based on ¬A, this is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY.\n\nAnswer: no"
