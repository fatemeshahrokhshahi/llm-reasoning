      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and 'Sam did not take a plane'. The question is whether we can infer 'Erin did not take a train'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let A be 'Sam took a plane' and B be 'Erin took a train'. The conditional rule is A → B, and we have ¬A.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (Sam did not take a plane) does not allow us to conclude B is false (Erin did not take a train) because there are other reasons Erin could have taken a train, such as taking a train herself or another mode of transportation.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Erin could have taken a train for many other reasons besides Sam taking a plane. This means we cannot conclude that Erin did not take a train just because Sam did not take a plane.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY, which is invalid. We cannot infer that Erin did not take a train from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
