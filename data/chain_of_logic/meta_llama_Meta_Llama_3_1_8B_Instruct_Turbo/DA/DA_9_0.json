      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. The question is whether we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B = 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A → B means 'If A, then B' and ¬A means 'A is false'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) does not allow us to conclude B is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt). We cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt just because Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways B could be true without A. For example, Mark might have bought the blue shirt because he wanted it, or because someone else bought it for him, or for many other reasons that have nothing to do with Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY. We cannot infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: no"
