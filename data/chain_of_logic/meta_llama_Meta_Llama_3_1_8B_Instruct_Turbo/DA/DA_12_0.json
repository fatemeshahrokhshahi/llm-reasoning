The question is whether we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - The conditional rule is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This can be broken down into two elements: 'Joe went to the park' (A) and 'Lucy went to the zoo' (B).\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B, where A is 'Joe went to the park' and B is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (Joe did not go to the park) does not allow us to conclude B is false (Lucy did not go to the zoo) because there are other reasons Lucy could have gone to the zoo.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Lucy could have gone to the zoo for many other reasons, such as she wanted to visit the zoo, she was with someone else, or she went on a different day. The fact that Joe did not go to the park does not provide any information about Lucy's actions.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY, which is invalid. We cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo just because Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no"
