      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' and 'The cake was not chocolate'. The question is whether we can infer 'The muffins were not blueberry'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements: \n- A: The cake was chocolate\n- B: The muffins were blueberry\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A is 'The cake was chocolate' and B is 'The muffins were blueberry'.\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (¬A) does not allow us to conclude B is false (¬B) because there could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways the muffins could be blueberry without the cake being chocolate. For example, the muffins could be blueberry because they were made with blueberry flavoring, regardless of the cake's color.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY, which is invalid. We cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
