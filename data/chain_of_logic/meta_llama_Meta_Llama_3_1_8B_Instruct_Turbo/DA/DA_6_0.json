The question is whether we can infer 'Bob did not choose pasta'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - The conditional rule is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'. This can be broken down into two elements: 'Sue chose pizza' (A) and 'Bob chose pasta' (B).\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A is 'Sue chose pizza' and B is 'Bob chose pasta'.\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (Sue did not choose pizza) does not allow us to conclude B is false (Bob did not choose pasta) because there could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - B could be true for many other reasons besides A. For example, Bob might have chosen pasta because he likes it, or because he was in the mood for it, or because someone else chose it for him, etc.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY. The premises do not entail the conclusion, and we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
