      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and 'The doll was not plastic'. The question is whether we can infer 'The truck was not metal'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'The doll was plastic' and B = 'The truck was metal'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬A, where A → B is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and ¬A is 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false (¬A) allows us to conclude B is false (¬B). However, we need to consider if there are other ways B could be true without A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There could be other reasons why the truck was metal, such as it being made of metal by default or being made of metal for a specific reason. The fact that the doll is not plastic does not necessarily imply that the truck is not metal.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we cannot conclude that the truck is not metal solely based on the doll not being plastic, this is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY.\n\nAnswer: no"
