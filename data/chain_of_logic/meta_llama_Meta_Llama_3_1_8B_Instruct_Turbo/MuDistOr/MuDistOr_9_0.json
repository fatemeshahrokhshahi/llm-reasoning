The scope of the necessity operator □ is crucial here.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if modal necessity distributes over disjunction. However, as per the critical rule, necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that the original statement implies that the package must have been delivered by either truck or plane, but it does not imply that the package must have been delivered by truck or that it must have been delivered by plane.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction, we can conclude that the original statement does not imply the proposed distribution.\n\nAnswer: no"
