However, we know from the critical rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that □(p ∨ q) implies that both p and q must be true, but it does not imply that p must be true or q must be true. This is a fundamental modal logic fallacy.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule, we can conclude that the modal distribution is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
