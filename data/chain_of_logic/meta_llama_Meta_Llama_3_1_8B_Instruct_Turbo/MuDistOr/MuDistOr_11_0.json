However, we know from the CRITICAL RULE that necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal necessity distributes over disjunction, but we know it does not.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that the original statement implies that the exam must have been either multiple choice or essay-based, but it does not imply that each option must be necessary separately.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the CRITICAL RULE that necessity does not distribute over disjunction, we cannot infer 'The exam must have been multiple choice or it must have been essay-based' from 'The exam must have been multiple choice or essay-based'.\n\nAnswer: no"
