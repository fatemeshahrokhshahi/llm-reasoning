This is a critical point, as the scope of the necessity operator matters crucially.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the CRITICAL RULE that necessity does not distribute over disjunction, we cannot infer 'The concert must have been indoors or it must have been outdoors' from 'The concert must have been indoors or outdoors'.\n\nAnswer: no"
