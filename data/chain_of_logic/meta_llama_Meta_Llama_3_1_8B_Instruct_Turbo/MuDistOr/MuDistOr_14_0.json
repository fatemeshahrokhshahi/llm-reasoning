However, we know from the CRITICAL RULE that necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if □(p ∨ q) ⊢ □p ∨ □q. However, based on the CRITICAL RULE, we know that this is not a valid inference.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that the original statement is a single statement of necessity over a disjunction. This means that the necessity operator applies to the entire disjunction, not to each individual disjunct separately.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the CRITICAL RULE, we can conclude that the inference from 'The payment must have been made by credit card or bank transfer' to 'The payment must have been made by credit card or it must have been made by bank transfer' is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
