This is crucial because the scope of the necessity operator matters.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the CRITICAL RULE that necessity does not distribute over disjunction, we can conclude that 'The movie must have been in English or subtitled' does not imply 'The movie must have been in English or it must have been subtitled'.\n\nAnswer: no"
