However, the original statement is a disjunction, not a conjunction.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement, we see that 'The document must have been signed or notarized' is equivalent to □(p ∨ q), where p is 'The document must have been signed' and q is 'The document must have been notarized'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if □(p ∨ q) ⊢ □p ∨ □q. However, as per the critical rule, necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that the original statement implies that the document must have been either signed or notarized, but it does not imply that the document must have been signed or that it must have been notarized separately.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule, we cannot infer 'The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized' from 'The document must have been signed or notarized'.\n\nAnswer: no"
