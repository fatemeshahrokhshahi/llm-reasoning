The proposed distribution is □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between □(p ∨ q) and □p ∨ □q, we need to determine if □(p ∨ q) ⊢ □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the modal necessity distributes over disjunction. However, according to the critical rule, necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that the original statement 'The experiment must have been conducted in a lab or in the field' implies that the experiment was conducted in either a lab or the field, but it does not imply that it must have been conducted in a lab or that it must have been conducted in the field. The scope of the necessity operator matters crucially here.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction, we cannot infer 'The experiment must have been conducted in a lab or it must have been conducted in the field' from 'The experiment must have been conducted in a lab or in the field'.\n\nAnswer: no"
