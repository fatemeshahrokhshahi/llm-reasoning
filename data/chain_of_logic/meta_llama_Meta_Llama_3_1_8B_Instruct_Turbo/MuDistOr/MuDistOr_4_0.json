The proposed distribution is 'The keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook', which can be represented as □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down □(p ∨ q) and □p ∨ □q components, we have □(p ∨ q) = □p ∨ □q is not a valid decomposition because it is a fallacy.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between □(p ∨ q) and □p ∨ □q, we can see that □(p ∨ q) does not necessarily imply □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if modal necessity distributes over disjunction, we can see that it does not. The scope of the necessity operator matters crucially.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators and logical fallacy, we can see that the original statement 'The keys must have been in the drawer or on the hook' implies that the keys must have been in the drawer or on the hook, but it does not imply that the keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Distribution is valid, we can conclude that it is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
