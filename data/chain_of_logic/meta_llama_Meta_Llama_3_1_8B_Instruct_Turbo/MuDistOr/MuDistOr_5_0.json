However, we know from the critical rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that the original statement 'The meeting must have been on Monday or Tuesday' implies that the meeting must have been on either Monday or Tuesday, but it does not imply that it must have been on Monday or that it must have been on Tuesday separately.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction, we can conclude that the inference 'The meeting must have been on Monday or it must have been on Tuesday' is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
