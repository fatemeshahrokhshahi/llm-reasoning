      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt', which can be written as 'If Lisa bought the red shirt (p), then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (□q)'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt', which can be written as ¬□q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → □q) and the negation of necessity (¬□q) into their components. The conditional statement implies that if p is true, then □q must be true. The negation of necessity implies that □q is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q. This expression implies that if p is true, then □q must be true, but it's also not the case that □q is necessarily true. This creates a contradiction.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. The negated modal necessity (¬□q) implies that q is not necessarily true. This contradicts the conditional statement (p → □q), which implies that if p is true, then □q must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships. The modal scope of □q is the entire conditional statement (p → □q). The negation of necessity (¬□q) affects the entire conditional statement, making it invalid.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid. Since the conditional statement (p → □q) and the negation of necessity (¬□q) create a contradiction, we can infer that p is not necessarily true. Therefore, we can infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' (¬p).\n\nAnswer: yes"
