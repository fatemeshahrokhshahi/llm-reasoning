      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim', which can be written as 'If p then □q', where p is 'the shirt was cotton' and q is 'the pants must have been denim'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim', which can be written as ¬□q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement into its components, we have p → □q and ¬□q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we see that it is a combination of a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent. This is similar to the classic Modus Tollens, where (p → q) ∧ ¬q ⊢ ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports Modus Tollens. In this case, the negation of necessity 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim' contradicts the conditional statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim' directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim'. This means that the antecedent 'the shirt was cotton' cannot be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, we see that it is indeed valid. The negation of necessity 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim' supports the inference that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
