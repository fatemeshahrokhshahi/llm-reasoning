      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue', which can be written as 'If p then □q', where p is 'the car was red' and q is 'the truck was blue'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the truck must have been blue', which can be written as ¬□q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement and the negation of necessity, we have p → □q and ¬□q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statement (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it supports the conclusion ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negated modal necessity (¬□q) contradicts the conditional statement (p → □q), which is a key component of modal modus tollens.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity (¬□q) directly contradicts the necessity part of the conditional statement (□q). This contradiction supports the conclusion that the antecedent (p) is not true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the given statement (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q supports the conclusion ¬p, making the inference 'The car was not red' valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
