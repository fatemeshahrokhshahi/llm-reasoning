The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter', which can be written as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'. \n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it is a combination of the conditional statement and the negation of necessity. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negated modal necessity '¬□q' contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q', which means that if 'p' is true, then 'q' cannot be necessarily true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negated modal necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This means that if 'p' is true, then 'q' cannot be necessarily true, which implies that 'q' is not true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since 'q' is not true, we can infer that 'p' is not true, which means that 'The alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
