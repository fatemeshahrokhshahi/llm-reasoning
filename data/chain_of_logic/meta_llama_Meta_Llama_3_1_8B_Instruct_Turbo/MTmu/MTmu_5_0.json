      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis', which can be written as 'If Jeff played basketball, then □Amy played tennis'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis', which can be written as ¬□Amy played tennis.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'If Jeff played basketball, then □Amy played tennis' as (Jeff played basketball) → □(Amy played tennis). The negation of necessity is ¬□(Amy played tennis).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (Jeff played basketball) → □(Amy played tennis) ∧ ¬□(Amy played tennis), we can see that it is a combination of a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negated modal necessity is ¬□(Amy played tennis), which contradicts the conditional statement (Jeff played basketball) → □(Amy played tennis).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negated modal necessity directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement. This means that if it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis, then it cannot be the case that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, we can see that it is indeed valid. The negated modal necessity directly supports the negation of the antecedent, which is 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
