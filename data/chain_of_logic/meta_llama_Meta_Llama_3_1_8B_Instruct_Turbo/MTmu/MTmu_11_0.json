The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry', which can be written as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it is a combination of the conditional statement and the negation of necessity. This expression is a form of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negation of necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q', which means that if the muffins were not necessarily blueberry, then it cannot be the case that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negation of necessity '¬□q' directly affects the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This means that the truth of '¬□q' directly implies the falsity of 'p → □q'.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, we can see that it is indeed valid. The negation of necessity '¬□q' directly supports the conclusion '¬p', which means that we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
