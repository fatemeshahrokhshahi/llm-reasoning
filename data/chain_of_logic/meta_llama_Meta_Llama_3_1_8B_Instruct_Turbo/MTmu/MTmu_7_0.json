The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Chris must have finished the face', which can be written as ¬□Chris finished the race.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'If Alex finished the race, then □Chris finished the race' which is equivalent to 'Alex finished the race → □Chris finished the race'. The negation of necessity is already given as ¬□Chris finished the race.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statements, we have (Alex finished the race → □Chris finished the race) ∧ ¬□Chris finished the race. We need to determine if this implies ¬Alex finished the race.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negation of modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negation of modal necessity is 'It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race', which contradicts the conditional statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of modal necessity 'It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race' directly contradicts the conditional statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race'. This is because the negation of modal necessity implies that Chris did not necessarily finish the race, which contradicts the conditional statement that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the given statements imply that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
