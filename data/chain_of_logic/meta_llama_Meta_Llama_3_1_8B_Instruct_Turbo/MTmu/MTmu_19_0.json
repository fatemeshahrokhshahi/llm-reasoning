      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'Tom watched football' and 'q' is 'Jen watched basketball'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball', which can be written as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'. The first statement implies that if 'p' is true, then 'q' must be true. The second statement implies that 'q' is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it combines the two statements. The first part 'p → □q' implies that if 'p' is true, then 'q' must be true. The second part '¬□q' implies that 'q' is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity '¬□q' supports modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid rule of inference, and the modal version of it is also valid. The negated modal necessity '¬□q' contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q', which implies that if 'p' is true, then 'q' must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negated modal necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This means that if 'q' is not necessarily true, then the conditional statement 'p → □q' is false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, we can conclude that if the conditional statement 'p → □q' is false, then 'p' must be false. Therefore, we can infer that 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
