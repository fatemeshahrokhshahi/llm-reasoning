      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo', which can be represented as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'Joe went to the park' and 'q' is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo', which can be represented as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' (if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo) and '¬□q' (it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it is a combination of the conditional statement and the negation of necessity. This expression is similar to the classic Modus Tollens, but with a modal twist.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - To test if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens, we need to examine the logical relationships between the statements. The negation of necessity '¬□q' implies that it's possible for Lucy not to have gone to the zoo, which contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negation of necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This is because the negation of necessity implies that it's not necessary for Lucy to have gone to the zoo, which contradicts the idea that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the Modal Modus Tollens is valid in this case. Therefore, we can infer that 'Joe did not go to the park' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
