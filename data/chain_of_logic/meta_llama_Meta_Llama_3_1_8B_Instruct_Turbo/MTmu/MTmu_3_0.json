The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel', which can be represented as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'. \n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it is a combination of the conditional statement and the negation of necessity. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negated modal necessity '¬□q' contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q', which is a key component of the modal modus tollens.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negated modal necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the necessity part of the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This means that if 'q' is not necessary, then the condition 'p' cannot lead to 'q' being necessary.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the modal modus tollens, we can infer that if the negated modal necessity '¬□q' is true, then the conditional statement 'p → □q' must be false. Since the conditional statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel', the negation of this statement would be 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
