      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'the griffin was in the forest' and 'q' is 'the unicorn must have been in the forest'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest', which can be written as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q ⊢ ¬p', we can see that it is a modal version of the classic Modus Tollens. The modal version states that if 'p' implies '□q' and '□q' is not the case, then 'p' must not be the case.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens, we can see that it does. The negated modal necessity '¬□q' contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q', which means that if 'p' is true, then '□q' must be true. However, since '¬□q' is true, we can conclude that 'p' must not be the case.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the modal operator '□' is applied to 'q', which means that 'q' is necessarily true if 'p' is true. However, since '¬□q' is true, we can conclude that 'q' is not necessarily true, which means that 'p' must not be the case.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, we can see that it is. The classic Modus Tollens is valid, and the modal version is a direct extension of the classic version. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The griffin was not in the forest' is a valid inference from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
