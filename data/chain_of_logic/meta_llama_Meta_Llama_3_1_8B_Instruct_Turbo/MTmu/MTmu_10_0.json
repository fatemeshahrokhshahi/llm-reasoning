      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside', which can be represented as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'the dog was inside' and 'q' is 'the cat was outside'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the cat must have been outside', which can be represented as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'. \n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it is a combination of the conditional statement and the negation of necessity. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negated modal necessity '¬□q' contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q', which means that if the cat was not necessarily outside, then the dog must not have been inside.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negation of necessity '¬□q' directly affects the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This means that if the cat was not necessarily outside, then the conditional statement 'p → □q' is false, and therefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, we can see that it is a valid application of the rule, as the negated modal necessity directly supports the inference of the negation of the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
