      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'the vampire was awake' and 'q' is 'the mummy was awake'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake', which can be written as ¬□q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and ¬□q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we can see that it is a combination of a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent. This is similar to the classic Modus Tollens, where (p → q) ∧ ¬q ⊢ ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens, we can see that 'It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake' contradicts 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake'. This is because the negation of necessity (¬□q) implies that the mummy might not have been awake, which contradicts the conditional statement that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negation of necessity (¬□q) affects the consequent of the conditional statement (□q). This means that the conditional statement (p → □q) is no longer valid, and we cannot infer that the mummy must have been awake if the vampire was awake.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, we can see that it is indeed valid. The negation of necessity (¬□q) supports modus tollens, and we can infer that 'The vampire was not awake' (¬p).\n\nAnswer: yes"
