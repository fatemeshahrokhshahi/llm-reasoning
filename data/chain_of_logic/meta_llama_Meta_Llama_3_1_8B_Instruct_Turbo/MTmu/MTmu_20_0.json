      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'the apple was red' and 'q' is 'the banana was yellow'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', which can be written as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement 'p → □q' and the negation of necessity '¬□q' into their components, we have 'p → □q' as 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' and '¬□q' as 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it is a combination of the conditional statement and the negation of necessity. This statement can be read as 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, and it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statement, we need to test if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negated modal necessity '¬□q' contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q', which suggests that we can indeed infer 'The apple was not red'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negation of necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the necessity part of the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This contradiction supports the inference that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the given statement '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q' indeed supports the inference 'The apple was not red'. This is because the negated modal necessity '¬□q' contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q', which is a characteristic of modal modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
