      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'Ben ate pasta' and 'q' is 'Kate must have eaten the salad'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad', which can be written as ¬□q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and ¬□q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we can see that it is a combination of a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent. This is similar to the classic Modus Tollens, where (p → q) ∧ ¬q ⊢ ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - In this case, the negated modal necessity (¬□q) supports the application of Modal Modus Tollens, which states that (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q ⊢ ¬p.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the statement 'It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad' directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad'. This contradiction supports the application of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the application of Modal Modus Tollens, we can conclude that (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q ⊢ ¬p, which means that 'Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
