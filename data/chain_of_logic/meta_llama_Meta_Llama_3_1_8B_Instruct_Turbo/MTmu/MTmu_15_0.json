The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train', which can be written as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we see that it is a conjunction of two statements. The first statement 'p → □q' implies that if 'p' is true, then 'q' must be true. The second statement '¬□q' implies that 'q' is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity '¬□q' supports modus tollens. In modus tollens, if we have 'p → q' and '¬q', we can infer '¬p'. In this case, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q', which is similar to '¬q'. We need to examine the modal scope and logical relationships to determine if this is a valid inference.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that '¬□q' contradicts 'p → □q'. This is because 'p → □q' implies that if 'p' is true, then 'q' must be true, but '¬□q' implies that 'q' is not necessarily true. This contradiction supports the inference that 'p' is not true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the inference 'Sam did not take a plane' is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
