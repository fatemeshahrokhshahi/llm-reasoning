      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'the bear was in the cave' and 'q' is 'the wolf was in the den'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den', which can be written as '¬□q'. \n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement 'p → □q' and the negation of necessity '¬□q' into their components, we have 'If the bear was in the cave' (p) and 'the wolf was in the den' (□q), and 'the wolf was not necessarily in the den' (¬□q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we see that it is a combination of the conditional statement and the negation of necessity. This is the same form as the classic Modus Tollens, but with 'must' instead of a simple implication.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, 'It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den' contradicts 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den', which means that the wolf was not necessarily in the den if the bear was in the cave.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the necessity in the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This means that the wolf was not necessarily in the den, which directly supports the conclusion that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, we see that it follows the same logical structure as the classic Modus Tollens, but with 'must' instead of a simple implication. Therefore, the conclusion 'The bear was not in the cave' is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
