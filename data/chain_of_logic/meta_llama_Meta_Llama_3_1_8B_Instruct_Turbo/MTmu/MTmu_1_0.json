The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding', which can be written as ¬□Sue was at the wedding.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'If Mary was at the wedding' (p) and 'then □Sue was at the wedding' (□q). The negation of necessity is ¬□Sue was at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we see that it is a combination of a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent. This is similar to the classic Modus Tollens, but with a modal twist.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negation of necessity 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding' contradicts the conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding' directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding'. This is because the negation of necessity implies that it is possible for Sue not to be at the wedding, which contradicts the idea that Sue must be at the wedding if Mary is.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the modal modus tollens rule, we can infer that if the consequent of the conditional statement is not necessary, then the antecedent of the conditional statement must be false. Therefore, we can infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
