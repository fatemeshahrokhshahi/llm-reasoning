      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'Sue chose pizza' and 'q' is 'Bob chose pasta'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta', which can be written as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'. \n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it is a combination of a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent. This is similar to the classic Modus Tollens, where 'p → q' and '¬q' are used to infer '¬p'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports Modus Tollens. In this case, '¬□q' contradicts the idea that 'if p then □q', which is the essence of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we can see that the negation of necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This means that the conditional statement is not true, and therefore, we can infer that 'p' is not true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the Modal Modus Tollens is valid in this case, and we can infer '¬p', which means 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
