      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal', which can be written as 'p → □q', where 'p' is 'the doll was plastic' and 'q' is 'the truck must have been metal'. The negation of necessity is 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal', which can be written as '¬□q'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have 'p → □q' and '¬□q'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression '(p → □q) ∧ ¬□q', we can see that it is a combination of the conditional statement and the negation of necessity. This expression is a form of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - To test if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens, we need to examine the logical relationships between the statements. The negation of necessity '¬□q' implies that 'q' is not necessarily true, which contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope, we can see that the negation of necessity '¬□q' directly contradicts the conditional statement 'p → □q'. This means that if 'q' is not necessarily true, then the conditional statement 'p → □q' must be false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the conditional statement 'p → □q' is false, we can infer that 'p' must be true. This is because if 'p' were false, the conditional statement would be true by default. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
