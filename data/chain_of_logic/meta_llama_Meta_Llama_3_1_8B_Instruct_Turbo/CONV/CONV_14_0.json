It only states that if the bear is in the case, then the wolf is in the den.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, we can see that the wolf could be in the den for reasons unrelated to the bear's presence in the case. For example, the wolf might have been there before the bear entered the case.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, we conclude that it is. The original statement does not imply the converse, and the converse is not logically equivalent to the original.\n\nAnswer: no"
