We're asked to infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the vampire was awake' and B = 'the mummy was awake'. The converse is 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) → (B → A), where A = 'the vampire was awake' and B = 'the mummy was awake'.\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its converse. The fact that the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake does not logically imply that the mummy being awake implies the vampire being awake.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The mummy could be awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire, such as the mummy being naturally awake or being woken by another entity.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, as the original conditional does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: no"
