We're asked to infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Alex finished the race' and B = 'Chris finished the race'. The converse is 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) → (B → A).\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its converse. The fact that Alex finishing the race implies Chris finishing the race does not logically imply that Chris finishing the race implies Alex finishing the race.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We can analyze if B could be true without A being the cause. For example, Chris might have finished the race because he was the only one left, not because Alex finished it. This shows that B can be true without A being the cause.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since B can be true without A being the cause, this is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY.\n\nAnswer: no"
