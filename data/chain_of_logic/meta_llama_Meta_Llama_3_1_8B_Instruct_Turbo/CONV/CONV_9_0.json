It only states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, we can see that Mark buying the blue shirt could be independent of Lisa buying the red shirt. There's no logical connection between the two events.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, we see that it is. The original conditional statement does not imply the converse, and this is a fundamental logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
