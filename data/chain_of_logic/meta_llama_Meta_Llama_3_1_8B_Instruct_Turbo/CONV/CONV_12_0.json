We're asked to infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements (A, B), we have A: 'Joe went to the park' and B: 'Lucy went to the zoo'. The converse is 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is: (A → B) → (B → A)?\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its converse. The fact that Joe going to the park implies Lucy going to the zoo does not logically imply that Lucy going to the zoo implies Joe going to the park.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Lucy could go to the zoo for various reasons, not necessarily because Joe went to the park. This shows that B could be true without A being the cause.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, which is invalid. The original conditional does not entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: no"
