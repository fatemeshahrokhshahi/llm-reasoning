We're asked to infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding'.\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Mary was at the wedding' and B = 'Sue was at the wedding'. The converse would be 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding'.\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form is (A → B) → (B → A).\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not prove its converse. The fact that Mary being at the wedding implies Sue being at the wedding does not logically imply that Sue being at the wedding implies Mary being at the wedding.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We cannot assume that Sue being at the wedding is a result of Mary being at the wedding. There could be other reasons for Sue's presence at the wedding.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, which is invalid. The original conditional does not entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: no"
