The correct expression is (A → B) → (¬B → ¬A).\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its converse, we see that the original statement does not directly imply the converse. The original statement only tells us that if the dog is inside, the cat is outside, but it does not tell us that if the cat is outside, the dog is inside.\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, we can see that the cat could be outside for reasons unrelated to the dog's location. For example, the cat might be outside because it chose to go out, or because someone opened the door, or because of some other reason that has nothing to do with the dog's location.\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, we see that it is indeed a case of the conversion fallacy. The original statement does not imply the converse, and the converse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
