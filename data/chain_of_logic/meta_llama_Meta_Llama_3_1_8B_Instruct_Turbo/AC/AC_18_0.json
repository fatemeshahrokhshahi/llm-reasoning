      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' (p → q), and the consequent affirmation is 'The truck was metal' (q). We are trying to infer 'The doll was plastic' (p).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) and the consequent affirmation (q) gives us: 'If the doll was plastic' (p) and 'then the truck was metal' (q), and we know 'The truck was metal' (q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → q) ∧ q, we see that it is a conjunction of the conditional statement and the consequent affirmation. However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that because the consequent (q) is true, the antecedent (p) must also be true. However, this is not a valid inference.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that the conditional statement (p → q) only implies that if p is true, then q must be true. It does not imply that if q is true, then p must be true. Additionally, there could be multiple causes for the truck being metal, not just the doll being plastic.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that affirming the consequent is invalid, we can conclude that from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' together with 'The truck was metal', we cannot infer 'The doll was plastic'.\n\nAnswer: no"
