This does not directly imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that because the consequent (q) is true, the antecedent (p) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The conditional statement (p → q) implies that if the dog is inside (p), then the cat is outside (q). However, it does not imply that if the cat is outside (q), then the dog is inside (p). There could be other reasons why the cat is outside, such as the cat going out on its own or someone letting it out.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we can conclude that affirming the consequent is not a valid inference in this case. The statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' and 'The cat was outside' does not necessarily imply 'The dog was inside'.\n\nAnswer: no"
