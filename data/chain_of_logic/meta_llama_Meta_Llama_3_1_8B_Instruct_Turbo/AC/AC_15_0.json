However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - If we affirm the consequent (Erin took a train), it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If A, then B' only implies that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not imply that if B is true, then A must be true. In this case, Erin taking a train does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since affirming the consequent (Erin took a train) does not necessarily imply the antecedent (Sam took a plane), this inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
