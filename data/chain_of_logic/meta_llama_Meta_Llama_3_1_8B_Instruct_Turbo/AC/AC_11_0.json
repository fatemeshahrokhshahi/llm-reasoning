      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' (p → q), and the consequent affirmation is 'The muffins were blueberry' (q).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement (p → q) and the consequent affirmation (q) gives us 'If the cake was chocolate' (p) and 'The muffins were blueberry' (q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement (p → q) ∧ q, we see that it combines the conditional statement with the consequent affirmation. However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that because the consequent (q) is true, the antecedent (p) must also be true. However, this is not a valid inference.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If A, then B' only implies that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not imply that if B is true, then A must be true. In this case, the fact that the muffins were blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if the Affirming the Consequent inference is valid, we conclude that it is not. The conditional statement and the consequent affirmation do not entail the antecedent affirmation.\n\nAnswer: no"
