      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', and the consequent affirmation is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'p' as 'Jeff played basketball' and 'q' as 'Amy played tennis'. The consequent affirmation is 'q', which is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the statement '(p → q) ∧ q', we see that it combines the conditional statement with the affirmation of the consequent. However, this does not necessarily imply 'p', as there could be other reasons for 'q' to be true.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that if 'q' is true, then 'p' must be true. However, this is not necessarily the case, as there could be alternative causes for 'q' to be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'p → q' only implies that if 'p' is true, then 'q' must be true. It does not imply that if 'q' is true, then 'p' must be true. Additionally, there could be multiple causes for 'q' to be true, which would invalidate the inference.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we can conclude that affirming the consequent is invalid in this case. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Jeff played basketball' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
