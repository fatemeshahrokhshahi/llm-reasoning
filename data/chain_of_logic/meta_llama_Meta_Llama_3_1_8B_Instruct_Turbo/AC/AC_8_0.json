However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that if the consequent (q) is true, then the antecedent (p) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that the conditional statement (p → q) implies that if p is true, then q must be true. However, it does not imply that if q is true, then p must be true. There could be other causes for q to be true, and it does not necessarily follow that p is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that affirming the consequent is invalid in this case. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The vampire was awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' together with 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nAnswer: no"
