However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the process of inferring the antecedent (p) from the conditional statement (p → q) and the consequent affirmation (q). However, this is a fundamental logical fallacy.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If A, then B' only implies that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not imply that if B is true, then A must be true. Additionally, multiple causes can lead to the same effect, so even if the banana was yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that affirming the consequent is invalid, we can conclude that inferring 'The apple was red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' together with 'The banana was yellow' is not a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
