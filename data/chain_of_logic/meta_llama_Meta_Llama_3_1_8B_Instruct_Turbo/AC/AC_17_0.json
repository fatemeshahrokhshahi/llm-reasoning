However, this does not necessarily imply the antecedent (p).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Affirming the consequent is the fallacy of assuming that if the consequent (q) is true, then the antecedent (p) must also be true. However, this is not a valid inference.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that the statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' only implies that if Ben ate pasta, Kate ate the salad. It does not imply that if Kate ate the salad, Ben ate pasta. Additionally, there could be other reasons why Kate ate the salad, such as she ordered it herself.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since affirming the consequent is a fundamental logical fallacy, we cannot infer 'Ben ate pasta' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
