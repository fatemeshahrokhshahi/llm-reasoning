The question is whether we can infer 'Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: Ben ate pasta\n- B: Kate ate the salad\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B (Kate did not eat the salad). The conditional rule tells us that if A (Ben ate pasta), then B (Kate ate the salad) must be true. However, we know that B is false, which means that A cannot be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can conclude that A (Ben ate pasta) must be false, because if A were true, B (Kate ate the salad) would have to be true, but we know that B is false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that ¬A (Ben did not eat pasta) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
