The question is whether we can infer 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: Tom watched football\n- B: Jen watched basketball\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B (Jen did not watch basketball). The conditional rule tells us that if A (Tom watched football), then B (Jen watched basketball) must be true. However, we know that B is false, which contradicts the conditional rule.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can see that the conditional rule (A → B) is violated because B is false. This means that A (Tom watched football) cannot be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that ¬A (Tom did not watch football) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
