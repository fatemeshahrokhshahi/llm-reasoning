      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. The question is whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: Lisa bought the red shirt\n- B: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬B, where A → B is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and ¬B is 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We need to check if the consequent B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is false. In this case, it is false because we know Mark did not buy the blue shirt (¬B). The conditional rule tells us that if A (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then B (Mark bought the blue shirt) must be true. However, since B is false, we can conclude that A (Lisa bought the red shirt) must also be false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can conclude that since B is false, A must also be false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
