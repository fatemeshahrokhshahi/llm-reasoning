The question is whether we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: Jeff played basketball\n- B: Amy played tennis\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬B, where A is 'Jeff played basketball', B is 'Amy played tennis', and ¬B is 'Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B (Amy played tennis) is false (¬B). The conditional rule (A → B) tells us that if A (Jeff played basketball), then B (Amy played tennis) must be true. However, we know that B is false. This creates a contradiction, which means that A (Jeff played basketball) must also be false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Since we have determined that A (Jeff played basketball) is false, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can infer that 'Jeff did not play basketball' from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
