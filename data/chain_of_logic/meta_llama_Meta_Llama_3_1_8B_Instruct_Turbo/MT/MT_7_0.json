The question is whether we can infer 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: Alex finished the race\n- B: Chris finished the race\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B = 'Chris did not finish the race'. The conditional tells us that if A (Alex finished the race), then B (Chris finished the race) must be true. However, we know that B is false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a conditional statement where the consequent is false. This means that the antecedent (A) must also be false, as the conditional rule states that if A, then B.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if the consequent B is false, then the antecedent A must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
