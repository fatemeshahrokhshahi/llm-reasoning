The question is whether we can infer 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: The doll was plastic\n- B: The truck was metal\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B (The truck was not metal). The conditional rule tells us that if A (The doll was plastic), then B (The truck was metal). Since B is false, we can infer that A is also false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would be metal, but the truck is not metal. Therefore, the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
