The question is whether we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: Joe went to the park\n- B: Lucy went to the zoo\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬B, where A is 'Joe went to the park' and B is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B (Lucy went to the zoo) is false, as Lucy did not go to the zoo. The conditional rule tells us that if A (Joe went to the park), then B (Lucy went to the zoo) must be true. However, since B is false, we cannot conclude that A is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Since we cannot conclude that A (Joe went to the park) is true, and we are given no other information about Joe's actions, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park. The information given does not provide a clear conclusion about Joe's actions.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule, we cannot infer 'Joe did not go to the park' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
