The question is whether we can infer 'The car was not red'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: The car was red\n- B: The truck was blue\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B (The truck was not blue). The conditional rule tells us that if A (The car was red), then B (The truck was blue) must be true. However, we know that B is false, so we cannot conclude A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a conditional rule that is not met. Since the consequent B is false, we cannot infer the antecedent A.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule, we cannot conclude ¬A (The car was not red) from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
