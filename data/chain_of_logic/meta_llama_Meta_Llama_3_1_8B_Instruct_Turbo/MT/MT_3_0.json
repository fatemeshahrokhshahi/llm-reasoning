The question is whether we can infer 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: The book was written by James.\n- B: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬B, where A → B is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' and ¬B is 'The book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are asked to check if the consequent B is false, and what the conditional tells us. In this case, B is false because the book is not a mystery novel. The conditional A → B tells us that if A (the book was written by James), then B (the book is a mystery novel) must be true. However, since B is false, we can conclude that A (the book was written by James) must also be false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can conclude that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can infer that 'The book was not written by James' from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
