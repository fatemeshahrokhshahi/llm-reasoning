The question is whether we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: The cake was chocolate\n- B: The muffins were blueberry\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬B, where A is 'The cake was chocolate' and B is 'The muffins were blueberry'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B (The muffins were blueberry) is false, as stated in the second premise 'The muffins were not blueberry'. The conditional rule tells us that if A (The cake was chocolate), then B (The muffins were blueberry) must be true. However, we know B is false, so we can conclude that A (The cake was chocolate) must also be false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can conclude that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can infer that 'The cake was not chocolate' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
