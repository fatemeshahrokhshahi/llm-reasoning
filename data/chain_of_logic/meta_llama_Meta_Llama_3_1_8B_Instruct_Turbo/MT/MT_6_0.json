The question is whether we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: Sue chose pizza\n- B: Bob chose pasta\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B (Bob did not choose pasta). The conditional rule tells us that if A (Sue chose pizza), then B (Bob chose pasta) must be true. However, since we know B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we can infer that if the consequent B is false, then the antecedent A must also be false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that ¬A (Sue did not choose pizza) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
