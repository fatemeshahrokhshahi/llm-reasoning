The question is whether we can infer 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. \n- A: The vampire was awake\n- B: The mummy was awake\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬B, where A is 'The vampire was awake', B is 'The mummy was awake', and ¬B is 'The mummy was not awake'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B (The mummy was awake) is false, as ¬B (The mummy was not awake) is true. The conditional rule (A → B) tells us that if A (The vampire was awake) is true, then B (The mummy was awake) must be true. However, we know that B is false. This creates a contradiction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Since the consequent B is false, and the conditional rule states that if A is true, then B must be true, we can conclude that A (The vampire was awake) must be false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
