The question is whether we can infer 'The alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the conditional rule into elements. A = 'The alien visited Mars', B = 'The robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬B, where A → B is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' and ¬B is 'The robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are asked to check if we can infer ¬A (The alien did not visit Mars). Since the consequent B (The robot visited Jupiter) is false (¬B), we can use the Modus Tollens rule to evaluate the conditional.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - The conditional rule (A → B) tells us that if A (The alien visited Mars) is true, then B (The robot visited Jupiter) must be true. However, we know that B is false (¬B). Therefore, we can conclude that A (The alien visited Mars) must also be false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that 'The alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
