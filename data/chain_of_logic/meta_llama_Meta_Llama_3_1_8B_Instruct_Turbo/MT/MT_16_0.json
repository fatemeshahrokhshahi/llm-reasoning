The question is whether we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: The shirt was cotton\n- B: The pants were denim\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B (The pants were not denim). The conditional rule tells us that if A (The shirt was cotton), then B (The pants were denim). Since we know ¬B, we can infer that A is not true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would be denim, but the pants are not denim. Therefore, the shirt must not be cotton.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
