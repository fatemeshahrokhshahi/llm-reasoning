The question is whether we can infer 'The dog was inside'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: The dog was inside\n- B: The cat was outside\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we see that 'The cat was not outside' (¬B) is true. The conditional tells us that if A (The dog was inside), then B (The cat was outside) must be true. However, we know B is false, so we cannot conclude A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we see that the conditional rule does not hold because B is false. Therefore, we cannot infer A.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule, we cannot conclude ¬A (The dog was inside) because the conditional rule does not hold.\n\nAnswer: no"
