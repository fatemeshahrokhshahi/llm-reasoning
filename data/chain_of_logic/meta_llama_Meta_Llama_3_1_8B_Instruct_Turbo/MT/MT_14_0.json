The question is whether we can infer 'The bear was not in the cave'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: The bear was in the cave\n- B: The wolf was in the den\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B, which is true. The conditional tells us that if A (the bear was in the cave), then B (the wolf was in the den) must be true. However, we know that B is false (the wolf was not in the den).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a conditional statement that is false when the antecedent is true. This means that the antecedent A (the bear was in the cave) must be false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if the wolf was not in the den (¬B), and if the bear was in the cave then the wolf was in the den (A → B), then the bear was not in the cave (¬A).\n\nAnswer: yes"
