      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The premises are 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' and 'Sue was not at the wedding'. The question is whether we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Mary was at the wedding' and B = 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the premises is (A → B) ∧ ¬B, where A → B is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' and ¬B is 'Sue was not at the wedding'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Since the consequent B is false (Sue was not at the wedding), the conditional rule (A → B) tells us that if A (Mary was at the wedding) were true, then B (Sue was at the wedding) would be true. However, we know that B is false, so we cannot conclude that A is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Since we cannot conclude that A is true, and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A (Mary was at the wedding) is not necessarily true. However, we cannot conclude that A is false either.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given premises. The conclusion is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no"
