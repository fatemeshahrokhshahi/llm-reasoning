The question is whether we can infer 'The apple was not red'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: The apple was red\n- B: The banana was yellow\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we see that 'The banana was not yellow' (¬B) is true. The conditional tells us that if A (The apple was red) then B (The banana was yellow) must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we see that the conditional rule (A → B) is not true because B is false. This means that A (The apple was red) cannot be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that 'The apple was not red' (¬A).\n\nAnswer: yes"
