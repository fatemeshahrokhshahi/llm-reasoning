The question is whether we can infer 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: Sam took a plane\n- B: Erin took a train\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false, we have ¬B (Erin did not take a train). The conditional tells us that if A (Sam took a plane), then B (Erin took a train) must be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a conditional statement (A → B) that is combined with the negation of B (¬B). This implies that A (Sam took a plane) cannot be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if the conditional (A → B) is true and the consequent B is false (¬B), then the antecedent A must be false (¬A). Therefore, we can infer that 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
