  "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

      "content": "Explanation:\n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims about the expected increase in rents, home prices, and mortgage rates. The conditional structure is: if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Additionally, we have the probability claims that rents likely will increase the most and home prices likely won’t increase the most.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the elements, we have:\n- The conditional statement: if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n- The probability claims: rents likely will increase the most, and home prices likely won’t increase the most.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the conditional statement and the probability claims, we can see that if home prices don’t increase the most, it implies that rents don’t increase the most, and then mortgage rates will increase the most. However, we also know that rents likely will increase the most, which implies that home prices won’t increase the most.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the likelihood transfers through the nested conditionals, we can see that the probability claim about rents likely increasing the most supports the conditional statement about home prices not increasing the most. However, the question is whether it follows that if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario, we can see that the conditional statement involves a low-probability outcome (home prices not increasing the most), which is supported by the probability claim about rents likely increasing the most. However, the question is whether the low-probability outcome (home prices not increasing the most) affects the likelihood of mortgage rates increasing the most.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if the Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid, we can see that the nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem. The probability claim about rents likely increasing the most supports the conditional statement about home prices not increasing the most, but it does not directly support the likelihood of mortgage rates increasing the most. Therefore, the inference breaks down, and it does not follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: no"
