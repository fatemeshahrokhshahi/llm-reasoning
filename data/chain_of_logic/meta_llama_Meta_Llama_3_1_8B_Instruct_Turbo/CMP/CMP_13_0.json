  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

      "content": "Explanation:\n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims. We have:\n- Tennessee (T) likely adds the most jobs.\n- Georgia (G) likely won't add the most jobs because Tennessee likely will.\n- Missouri (M) has significantly lower job growth than Tennessee and Georgia.\n- If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the elements:\n- Probabilities: T is likely, G is likely not, M has lower growth.\n- Nested conditionals: If G doesn't add the most, then if T doesn't, M will.\n- Question: Does it follow that if T doesn't add the most, M will?\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the nested conditionals:\n- If G doesn't add the most, then if T doesn't, M will. This is a conditional statement.\n- T likely adds the most jobs, which implies G likely won't. This is a separate statement.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals:\n- The question is whether the likelihood of T not adding the most jobs implies the likelihood of M adding the most jobs.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario:\n- The conditional statement \"if G doesn't add the most, then if T doesn't, M will\" creates a probability distribution problem.\n- The low probability of M adding the most jobs (due to its lower growth rate) makes the inference vulnerable to failure.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if the Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid:\n- The inference breaks down because the nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem.\n- The low probability of M adding the most jobs makes the inference invalid.\n\nAnswer: no"
