  "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims. We have the following information:\n- It's likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit this year.\n- If bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be.\n- It's likely that apples will be top and hence bananas won't be.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the information into elements:\n- Probabilities: It's likely that apples will be top, and it's likely that apples will be top and bananas won't be.\n- Nested conditionals: If bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be.\n- The question: Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given information:\n- If p → (q → r) and p is likely, does q → r become likely?\n- Here, p is \"apples will be top,\" q is \"bananas won't be,\" and r is \"oranges will be.\"\n- The given information implies that if bananas aren't top, then if apples aren't, oranges will be.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals:\n- The question is asking if the likelihood of apples not being top implies the likelihood of oranges being top.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario:\n- The given information creates a probability distribution problem.\n- The likelihood of apples not being top is not directly related to the likelihood of oranges being top.\n- The condition \"if bananas aren't the top seller\" introduces a low-probability outcome, which can break down the inference.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid:\n- The inference is not valid because the nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem.\n- The likelihood of apples not being top does not directly imply the likelihood of oranges being top.\n\nAnswer: no"
