  "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

      "content": "Explanation:\n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims. We have three new laws: minimum wage hike (M), paid family leave (P), and student loan forgiveness (L). The probabilities are: P(M) is high, P(P) is lower than P(M), and P(L) is low. We also have the following conditionals: if P doesn't happen, then if M doesn't happen, L will happen (P → (¬M → L)), and if M happens, then P won't happen (M → ¬P).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - We break down the question into elements: the probabilities of the laws, the nested conditionals, and the question about the likelihood of L given ¬M.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - We analyze the given conditionals: P → (¬M → L) and M → ¬P. Since M is likely, we can infer that P is unlikely. However, this does not directly affect the likelihood of L given ¬M.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We check if the likelihood transfers through the nested conditionals. The question is whether it's likely that if M doesn't happen, L will happen. The given conditionals do not directly provide information about the likelihood of L given ¬M.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We analyze the probability distribution in the conditional scenario. The conditional P → (¬M → L) implies that if P doesn't happen, then L will happen if M doesn't happen. However, since P is unlikely, the probability of ¬P is high. This means that the probability of ¬M → L is not directly affected by the high probability of M.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - We determine if the Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid. The given conditionals and probabilities do not provide a direct inference about the likelihood of L given ¬M. The high probability of M and the low probability of P do not necessarily imply that L is likely if M doesn't happen.\n\nAnswer: no"
