  "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The question involves a nested conditional structure with probability claims. We have the following claims:\n- Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers.\n- Tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n- If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the claims into elements:\n- P1: P(coffee retains the most morning drinkers) is high.\n- P2: P(tea retains the most morning drinkers) is low.\n- P3: If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the conditional structure:\n- We have P1 → P2 (coffee likely retains the most → tea likely won't retain the most).\n- We are given P1, so we can infer P2.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals:\n- We want to know if P1 → (¬P1 → P3) is likely.\n- Since P1 is likely, we can infer P2 (tea likely won't retain the most).\n- However, this doesn't directly affect the likelihood of P3 (soda retaining the most if coffee doesn't).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario:\n- The nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem.\n- Even if P1 is likely, the conditional P3 involves low-probability outcomes (tea not retaining the most and coffee not retaining the most).\n- This makes it difficult to transfer likelihood through the nested conditionals.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if the Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid:\n- The inference breaks down due to the probability distribution problem.\n- The likelihood of P3 (soda retaining the most if coffee doesn't) is not directly affected by P1 (coffee likely retaining the most).\n- Therefore, it does not follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: no"
