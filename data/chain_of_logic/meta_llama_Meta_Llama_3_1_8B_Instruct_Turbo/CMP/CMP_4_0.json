  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

      "content": "Explanation:\n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The problem involves conditional probabilities and nested conditionals. We have three candidates (Priya, Julian, and Diego) and the hiring manager's likelihood of offering the role to each of them. We also have a conditional statement: if Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Let's break down the information:\n- The hiring manager thinks it's most likely Priya will be offered the role (P(Priya) is high).\n- Julian is the second most likely candidate (P(Julian) is lower than P(Priya)).\n- Diego is a longshot (P(Diego) is low).\n- If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will (this is a conditional statement).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - We're given that it's likely Priya will get the offer and hence that Julian won't. This implies that P(Priya) is high, and P(Julian) is low.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We want to know if it follows that it's likely that, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will. This involves analyzing the conditional probability distribution.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Let's analyze the probability distribution in the conditional scenario. If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will. However, the probability of Julian not getting the offer is low (since P(Julian) is lower than P(Priya)). This means that the probability of Diego getting the offer, given that Priya doesn't, is also low.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - The nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem. While it's likely that Priya will get the offer and Julian won't, the inference breaks down when considering the conditional probability of Diego getting the offer, given that Priya doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no"
