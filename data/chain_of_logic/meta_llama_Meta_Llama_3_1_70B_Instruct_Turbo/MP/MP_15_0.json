The question is whether we can infer 'Erin took a train'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Sam took a plane' and B = 'Erin took a train'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true, we find that 'Sam took a plane' is indeed true according to the given premises. The conditional rule tells us that if 'Sam took a plane', then 'Erin took a train'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent A and a conditional rule that links A to B.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, since we have (A → B) and A, we can conclude B.\n\nAnswer: yes"
