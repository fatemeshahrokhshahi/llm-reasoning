The cake was chocolate.\nThe question is: Can we infer that the muffins were blueberry?\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The cake was chocolate.\nB = The muffins were blueberry.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true:\nFrom the given premises, we know that A (The cake was chocolate) is indeed true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince A is true, and we have the conditional rule A → B, we can use this information to infer B.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion:\nGiven (A → B) ∧ A, we can conclude B using Modus Ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
