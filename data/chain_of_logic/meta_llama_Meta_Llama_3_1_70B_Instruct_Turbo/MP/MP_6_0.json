The question is whether we can infer 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Sue chose pizza' and B = 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true, we find that 'Sue chose pizza' is indeed true according to the given premises. The conditional tells us that if 'Sue chose pizza', then 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have the conditional rule (A → B) and the fact that A is true. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, which states that (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B, we can conclude that B is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
