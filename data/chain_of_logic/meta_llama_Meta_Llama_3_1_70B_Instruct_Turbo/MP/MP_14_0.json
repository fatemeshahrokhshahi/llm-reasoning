The bear was in the cave.\nThe question is whether we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The bear was in the cave.\nB = The wolf was in the den.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true:\nFrom the given premises, we know that A (The bear was in the cave) is true.\nThe conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B (The wolf was in the den) is also true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince A is true and the conditional rule states that A implies B, we can conclude that B is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Ponens rule, (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B, we can infer that B (The wolf was in the den) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
