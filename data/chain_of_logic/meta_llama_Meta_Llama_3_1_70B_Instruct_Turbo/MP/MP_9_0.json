Lisa bought the red shirt.\nThe question is whether we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = Lisa bought the red shirt\nB = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true:\nFrom the given premises, we know that A (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince A is true and the conditional rule states that if A then B, we can use this information to infer B.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Ponens rule, which states that (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B, we can conclude that B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
