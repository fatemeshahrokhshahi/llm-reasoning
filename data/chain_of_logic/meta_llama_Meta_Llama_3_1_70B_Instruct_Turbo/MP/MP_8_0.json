The question is whether we can infer 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The vampire was awake' and B = 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true, we find that 'The vampire was awake' is indeed true according to the given premises. The conditional tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have the conditional rule (A → B) and the fact that A is true. This matches the Modus Ponens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B is true, i.e., 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
