The alien visited Mars.\nThe question is: Can we infer that the robot visited Jupiter?\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The alien visited Mars\nB = The robot visited Jupiter\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true:\nFrom the given premises, we know that A (The alien visited Mars) is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince A is true, and we have the conditional rule A → B, we can use this information to evaluate the logic.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Ponens rule to reach conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Ponens rule, which states that (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B, we can conclude that B (The robot visited Jupiter) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
