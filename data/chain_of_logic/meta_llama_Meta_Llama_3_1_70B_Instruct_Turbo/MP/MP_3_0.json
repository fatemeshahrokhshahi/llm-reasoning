The question is whether we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The book was written by James' and B = 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true, we find that 'The book was written by James' is indeed true according to the given premises. The conditional tells us that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent A and a conditional rule that guarantees the truth of B when A is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B is true because A is true and A → B.\n\nAnswer: yes"
