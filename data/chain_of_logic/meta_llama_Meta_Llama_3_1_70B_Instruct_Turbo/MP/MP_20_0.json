The question is whether we can infer 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The apple was red' and B = 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ A ⊢ B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the antecedent A is true, we find that 'The apple was red' is indeed given as true. According to the conditional rule, if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we have a true antecedent A and a conditional rule that guarantees B when A is true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Ponens rule, we can conclude that B is true, since A is true and A → B.\n\nAnswer: yes"
