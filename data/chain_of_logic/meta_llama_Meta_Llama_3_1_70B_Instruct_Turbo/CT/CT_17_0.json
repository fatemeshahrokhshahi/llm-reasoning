We are asked to infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Ben ate pasta' and B = 'Kate ate the salad'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'Ben ate pasta' and B = 'Kate ate the salad'. Substituting the values, we get ('Ben ate pasta' → 'Kate ate the salad') ≡ ('Kate did not eat the salad' → 'Ben did not eat pasta').\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that 'If A, then B' always implies 'If ¬B, then ¬A'. Therefore, the original statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' implies 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we can see that the contrapositive is indeed logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
