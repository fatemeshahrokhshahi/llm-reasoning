We are asked to infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B = 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B = 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. This means 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is logically equivalent to 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always valid. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
