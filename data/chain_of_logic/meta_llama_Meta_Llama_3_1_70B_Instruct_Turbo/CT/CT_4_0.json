We are asked to infer 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the alien visited Mars' and B = 'the robot visited Jupiter'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'the alien visited Mars' and B = 'the robot visited Jupiter'. This means 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' is logically equivalent to 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always valid. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we can see that the contrapositive is indeed a correct transformation of the original statement.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
