We are asked to infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the car was red' and B = 'the truck was blue'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'the car was red' and B = 'the truck was blue'. This translates to 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' ≡ 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that 'If A, then B' always implies 'If ¬B, then ¬A'. Therefore, the original statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' implies 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the contrapositive is indeed 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red', which matches the statement we are asked to infer.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can infer that 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' is a valid conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
