      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'. We are asked to infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the bear was in the cave' and B = 'the wolf was in the den'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'the bear was in the cave' and B = 'the wolf was in the den'. This translates to 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' ≡ 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that (A → B) always implies (¬B → ¬A). Therefore, the original statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' implies 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the contrapositive is indeed 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave', which matches the statement we are asked to infer.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can infer the statement 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
