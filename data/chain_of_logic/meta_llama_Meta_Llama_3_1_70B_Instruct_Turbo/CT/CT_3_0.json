We are asked to infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the book was written by James' and B = 'the book is a mystery novel'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'the book was written by James', B = 'the book is a mystery novel', ¬A = 'the book was not written by James', and ¬B = 'the book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that 'If A, then B' always implies 'If ¬B, then ¬A'. Therefore, the original statement implies its contrapositive.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the contrapositive 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' is indeed the correct transformation of the original statement.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
