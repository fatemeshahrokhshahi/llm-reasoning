The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'the dog was inside', B = 'the cat was outside', ¬A = 'the dog was not inside', and ¬B = 'the cat was not outside'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that 'If A, then B' always implies 'If ¬B, then ¬A'. Therefore, the original statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' implies 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the contrapositive 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside' is indeed logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can infer that 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside' is a valid conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
