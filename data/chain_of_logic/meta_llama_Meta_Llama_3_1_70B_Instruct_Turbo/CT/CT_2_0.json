      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. We are asked to infer 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the griffin was in the forest' and B = 'the unicorn was in the forest'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'the griffin was in the forest' and B = 'the unicorn was in the forest'. This means 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is logically equivalent to 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that (A → B) always implies (¬B → ¬A). Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
