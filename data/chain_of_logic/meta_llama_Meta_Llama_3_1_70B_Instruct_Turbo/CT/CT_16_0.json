We are asked to infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the shirt was cotton' and B = 'the pants were denim'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ≡ (¬B → ¬A), where A = 'the shirt was cotton' and B = 'the pants were denim'. So, (the shirt was cotton → the pants were denim) ≡ (the pants were not denim → the shirt was not cotton).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Applying the fundamental rule of contraposition, we know that the original statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' implies 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Verifying the logical transformation, we see that the contrapositive is indeed 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton', which matches the statement we are asked to infer.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Concluding based on the universal validity of contraposition, we know that the contrapositive is always valid, so we can infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
