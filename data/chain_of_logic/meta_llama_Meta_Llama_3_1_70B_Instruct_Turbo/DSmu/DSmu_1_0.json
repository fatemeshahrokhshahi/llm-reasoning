      "content": "Explanation: \nTo answer this question, we need to follow the 6-step reasoning process. \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - Identify the disjunction and modal statements: \nThe disjunction is 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden', which can be represented as (A ∨ □B), where A is 'Fido is inside' and □B is 'Fido must be in the garden'. The modal necessity statement is 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', which can be represented as ¬□B.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Break down disjunction (A ∨ □B) and modal necessity (¬□B): \nWe have a disjunction with a modal statement and a negated modal necessity statement.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyze: Does (A ∨ □B) ∧ ¬□B ⊢ A?\nWe need to determine if the given statements logically imply 'Fido is inside'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Test if negated modal necessity supports disjunctive syllogism: \nThe critical rule states that Disjunctive Syllogism with 'must' is invalid. This means that even if we have 'not necessarily B', it does not imply 'not B'. Both options can still be open.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examine the modal scope and logical relationships: \nThe modal scope of 'must' in the statement 'Fido must be in the garden' does not necessarily imply that Fido is actually in the garden. The negation of the modal necessity statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' does not provide enough information to conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this Disjunctive Syllogism with 'must' is valid: \nBased on the critical rule, we can conclude that the Disjunctive Syllogism with 'must' is invalid in this case.\n\nAnswer: No"
