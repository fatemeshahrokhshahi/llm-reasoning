      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - Identify the disjunction and modal statements: \nThe disjunction is 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor', which can be represented as (A ∨ □B), where A is 'the missing puzzle piece is in the box' and □B is 'it must be blending in on the floor'. The modal necessity statement is 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', which can be represented as ¬□B.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Break down disjunction (A ∨ □B) and modal necessity (¬□B): \nBreaking down the disjunction, we have two options: the missing puzzle piece is in the box (A) or it must be blending in on the floor (□B). The modal necessity statement ¬□B indicates that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyze: Does (A ∨ □B) ∧ ¬□B ⊢ A?\nWe need to determine if the given statements logically imply that the missing puzzle piece is in the box (A).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Test if negated modal necessity supports disjunctive syllogism:\nThe negated modal necessity ¬□B does not necessarily imply that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. It only indicates that it's not the case that it must be blending in on the floor.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - CRITICAL: Examine the modal scope and logical relationships:\nThe modal scope of □B is 'must be blending in on the floor', which is different from 'is blending in on the floor'. The negation of the modal necessity ¬□B does not rule out the possibility that the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determine if this Disjunctive Syllogism with 'must' is valid:\nAccording to the CRITICAL RULE, Disjunctive Syllogism with 'must' is INVALID. The negated modal necessity ¬□B does not imply that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, and therefore, it does not logically imply that the missing puzzle piece is in the box (A).\n\nAnswer: No"
