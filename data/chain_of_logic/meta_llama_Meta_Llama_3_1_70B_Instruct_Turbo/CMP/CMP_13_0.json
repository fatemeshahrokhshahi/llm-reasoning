  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The problem presents a nested conditional structure with probability claims. The statements are: \n- Tennessee likely will add the most jobs.\n- If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.\n- Georgia likely won’t add the most jobs because Tennessee likely will.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the elements:\n- Probabilities: Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, Georgia likely won’t.\n- Nested conditionals: If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.\n- The question: Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the nested conditional: If p → (q → r) and p is likely, does q → r become likely? Here, p is \"Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs,\" q is \"Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs,\" and r is \"Missouri will add the most jobs.\"\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals. The critical issue is whether the probability of Missouri adding the most jobs, given that Tennessee doesn’t, is high enough to be considered likely.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario. The problem states that Missouri's growth is significantly lower than the other two states. This implies that even if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri's chances of adding the most jobs are still relatively low.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid. Given the low probability of Missouri adding the most jobs, even in the conditional scenario, the inference breaks down. The likelihood of Missouri adding the most jobs does not become high enough to be considered likely, even if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs.\n\nAnswer: No"
