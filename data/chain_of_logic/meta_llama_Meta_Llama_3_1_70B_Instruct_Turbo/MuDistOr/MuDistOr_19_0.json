The proposed distribution is 'The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience', which can be represented as □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have □(p ∨ q) as the original statement and □p ∨ □q as the proposed distribution.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between □(p ∨ q) and □p ∨ □q, we need to determine if the necessity operator distributes over disjunction.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if modal necessity distributes over disjunction, we recall the critical rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that the necessity operator applies to the entire disjunction in the original statement, but the proposed distribution implies that the necessity operator applies separately to each disjunct.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the critical rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction, we conclude that the proposed distribution is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No"
