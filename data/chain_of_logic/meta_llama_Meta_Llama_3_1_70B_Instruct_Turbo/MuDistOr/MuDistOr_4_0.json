      "content": "Explanation: \nTo answer this question, we need to apply the 6-step reasoning process for modal logic. \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original modal statement is 'The keys must have been in the drawer or on the hook', which can be represented as □(p ∨ q), where p is 'The keys were in the drawer' and q is 'The keys were on the hook'. The proposed distribution is 'The keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook', which can be represented as □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have □(p ∨ q) as the original statement and □p ∨ □q as the proposed distribution.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between the two expressions, we need to determine if □(p ∨ q) ⊢ □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if modal necessity distributes over disjunction. According to the critical rule, necessity does not distribute over disjunction.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we see that the necessity operator applies to the entire disjunction in the original statement, but it applies separately to each disjunct in the proposed distribution. This is a crucial difference, as it indicates a potential logical fallacy.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction, we can conclude that the proposed distribution is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
