      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original modal statement is 'The car must have been in the garage or at the repair shop', which can be represented as □(p ∨ q), where p is 'The car was in the garage' and q is 'The car was at the repair shop'. The proposed distribution is 'The car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop', which can be represented as □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have □(p ∨ q) as the original statement and □p ∨ □q as the proposed distribution.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between the two, we need to determine if □(p ∨ q) ⊢ □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if modal necessity distributes over disjunction, which is a critical aspect of modal logic.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we recall the fundamental rule that necessity does not distribute over disjunction. This means that 'Must (A or B)' does not imply 'Must A or Must B'.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule, we conclude that the proposed distribution is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No"
