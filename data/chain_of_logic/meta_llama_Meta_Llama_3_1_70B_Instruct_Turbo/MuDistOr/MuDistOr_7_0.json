      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original modal statement is 'The flight must have been delayed or cancelled', which can be represented as □(p ∨ q), where p is 'The flight must have been delayed' and q is 'The flight must have been cancelled'. The proposed distribution is 'The flight must have been delayed or it must have been cancelled', which can be represented as □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have □(p ∨ q) as the original statement and □p ∨ □q as the proposed distribution.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between the two, we need to determine if □(p ∨ q) ⊢ □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if modal necessity distributes over disjunction, which is a critical aspect of modal logic.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we must consider the CRITICAL RULE that necessity does not distribute over disjunction. This means that 'The flight must have been delayed or cancelled' does not imply 'The flight must have been delayed or it must have been cancelled'.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the CRITICAL RULE, we can conclude that the proposed distribution is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
