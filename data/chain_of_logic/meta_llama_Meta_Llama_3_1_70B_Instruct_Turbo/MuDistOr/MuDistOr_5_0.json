      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original modal statement is \"The meeting must have been on Monday or Tuesday\", which can be represented as □(p ∨ q), where p is \"The meeting was on Monday\" and q is \"The meeting was on Tuesday\". The proposed distribution is \"The meeting must have been on Monday or it must have been on Tuesday\", which can be represented as □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have □(p ∨ q) as the original statement and □p ∨ □q as the proposed inference.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between the two, we need to determine if □(p ∨ q) ⊢ □p ∨ □q.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if modal necessity distributes over disjunction, which is a critical aspect of modal logic.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of the modal operators, we must consider the CRITICAL RULE that necessity does not distribute over disjunction. This means that \"Must (A or B)\" does not imply \"Must A or Must B\".\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the CRITICAL RULE, we can conclude that the proposed inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No"
