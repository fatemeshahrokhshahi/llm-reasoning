The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) → (B → A). This is the form of the converse.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its converse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about the pants being denim without the shirt being cotton.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B (the pants were denim) could be true without A (the shirt was cotton) being the cause, we realize that the pants could be denim regardless of the shirt's material. There's no logical connection that forces the shirt to be cotton just because the pants are denim.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed the conversion fallacy, as the original statement does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: no"
