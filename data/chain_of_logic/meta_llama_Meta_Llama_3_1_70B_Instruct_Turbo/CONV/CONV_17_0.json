The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) → (B → A).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its converse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Kate ate salad. It only tells us what happens if Ben ate pasta.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, we realize that Kate could have eaten salad for many reasons unrelated to Ben eating pasta. There's no logical connection that guarantees Ben ate pasta just because Kate ate salad.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, we conclude that it is indeed the conversion fallacy, as the original statement does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: No"
