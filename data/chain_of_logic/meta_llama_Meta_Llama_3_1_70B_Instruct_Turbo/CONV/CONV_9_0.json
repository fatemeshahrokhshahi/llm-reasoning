The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) → (B → A).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its converse, we realize that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Mark buys the blue shirt. It only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, we can see that Mark buying the blue shirt does not necessarily depend on Lisa buying the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed the conversion fallacy, as the original statement does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: No"
