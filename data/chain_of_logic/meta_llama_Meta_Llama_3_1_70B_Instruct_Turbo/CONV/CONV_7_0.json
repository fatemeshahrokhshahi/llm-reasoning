The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) → (B → A). This is the form we need to evaluate.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its converse, we realize that the original statement only guarantees that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, it does not provide any information about the situation where Chris finished the race without Alex finishing.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, we can see that Chris could have finished the race even if Alex didn't. There's no logical connection that forces Alex to finish the race if Chris finishes.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, we conclude that it is indeed the case. The original statement does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: no"
