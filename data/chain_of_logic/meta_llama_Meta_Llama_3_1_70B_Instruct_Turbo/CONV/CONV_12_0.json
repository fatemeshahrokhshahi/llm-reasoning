The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original statement is (A → B), and the converse is (B → A).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We need to check if the original conditional proves its converse. However, the original statement only guarantees that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. It does not provide any information about what happens if Lucy went to the zoo independently of Joe's actions.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the situation, we can see that Lucy could have gone to the zoo without Joe going to the park. There is no logical connection that forces Joe to go to the park if Lucy goes to the zoo.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original statement does not logically entail its converse, and there is no guarantee that B (Lucy going to the zoo) is caused by A (Joe going to the park), we have identified the Conversion Fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
