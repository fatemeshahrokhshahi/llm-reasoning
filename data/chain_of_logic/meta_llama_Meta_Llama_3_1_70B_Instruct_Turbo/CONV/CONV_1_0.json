The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original statement is (A → B), and the converse is (B → A). We are checking if (A → B) → (B → A).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide any information that would prove its converse. The presence of Sue at the wedding does not necessarily imply that Mary was also there.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the elements, we can see that B (Sue was at the wedding) could be true without A (Mary was at the wedding) being the cause. Sue could have been at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Conversion\" fallacy, where we are trying to infer the converse of the original statement. However, the converse is not logically equivalent to the original, and the original statement does not provide enough information to prove the converse.\n\nAnswer: No"
