The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) → (B → A). This is the converse of the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its converse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about the cat being outside causing the dog to be inside.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, we realize that the cat could be outside for many reasons unrelated to the dog's location. For example, the cat might be outside because it likes the sunshine or because it's hunting.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, we conclude that it is indeed a fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: no"
