The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) → (B → A). This is the form of the converse.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its converse, we realize that the original statement does not provide any information about other possible authors of mystery novels.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could be true without A being the cause, we can see that there are many other authors who write mystery novels. The fact that a book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean it was written by James.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" FALLACY, we conclude that it is indeed the conversion fallacy, as the original statement does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: No"
