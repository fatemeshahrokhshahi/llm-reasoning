The converse of the original statement is indeed 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) → (B → A). This is the form of the converse.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its converse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about the banana being yellow causing the apple to be red.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B (the banana was yellow) could be true without A (the apple was red) being the cause, we realize that the banana could be yellow due to various reasons unrelated to the apple's color.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Conversion\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed the case. The original statement does not logically entail its converse.\n\nAnswer: No"
