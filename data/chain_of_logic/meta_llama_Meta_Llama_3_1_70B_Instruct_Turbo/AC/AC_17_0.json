The statement can be represented as (p → q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statements, we have (p → q) ∧ q. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid, i.e., if (p → q) ∧ q ⊢ p.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Considering the directional nature of conditionals, we know that 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' only implies that if Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten the salad. However, it does not rule out other possibilities where Kate ate the salad without Ben eating pasta.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that affirming the consequent is invalid, we conclude that (p → q) ∧ q does not entail p. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Ben ate pasta' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
