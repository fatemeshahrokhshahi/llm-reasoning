      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and the consequent affirmation is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'Lisa bought the red shirt' (p) and 'Mark bought the blue shirt' (q). The statement can be represented as (p → q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statements, we have (p → q) ∧ q. We need to determine if this expression entails p, which is 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case. The question is whether 'Mark bought the blue shirt' (q) implies 'Lisa bought the red shirt' (p).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - It's crucial to examine the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, it does not rule out other possibilities that could lead to Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that affirming the consequent is invalid, we conclude that 'Mark bought the blue shirt' does not necessarily imply 'Lisa bought the red shirt'. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
