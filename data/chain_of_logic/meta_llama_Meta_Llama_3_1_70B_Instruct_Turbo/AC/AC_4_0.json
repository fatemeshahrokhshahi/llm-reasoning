The conditional statement only guarantees that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, but it does not rule out other possible causes for the robot visiting Jupiter. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the fundamental logical fallacy of affirming the consequent, we cannot infer 'p' from (p → q) ∧ q. The conditional statement only works in one direction, and multiple causes can lead to the same effect.\n\nAnswer: no"
