The fact that the mummy was awake does not necessarily mean the vampire was awake, as there could be other reasons for the mummy being awake. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
