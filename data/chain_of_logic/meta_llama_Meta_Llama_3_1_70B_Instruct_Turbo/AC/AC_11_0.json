According to the rules of logic, this expression does not entail 'p'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case. However, as per the critical rule, affirming the consequent is invalid.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' only implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, but it does not imply that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. There could be multiple causes for the muffins being blueberry.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we conclude that affirming the consequent in this case is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
