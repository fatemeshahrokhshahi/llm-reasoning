      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' and the consequent affirmation is 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'Tom watched football' (p) and 'Jen watched basketball' (q). The statement can be represented as (p → q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statements, we have (p → q) ∧ q. We need to determine if this expression entails p, which is 'Tom watched football'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case. However, according to the critical rule, affirming the consequent is invalid.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' only implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. It does not imply that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football. There could be alternative causes for Jen watching basketball.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we conclude that affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Tom watched football' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
