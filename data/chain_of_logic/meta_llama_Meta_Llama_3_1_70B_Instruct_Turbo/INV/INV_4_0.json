We are checking if this implies ¬A → ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide any information about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars. It only tells us what happens when the alien does visit Mars.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - It is possible that the robot visited Jupiter regardless of whether the alien visited Mars or not. The original statement does not rule out this possibility.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars, and it is possible for the robot to visit Jupiter regardless of the alien's actions, we cannot infer the inverse statement. This would be an example of the inversion fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
