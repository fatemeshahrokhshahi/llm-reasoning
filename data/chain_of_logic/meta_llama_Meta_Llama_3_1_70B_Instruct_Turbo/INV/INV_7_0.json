We are asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Alex doesn't finish the race.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we realize that Chris could still finish the race even if Alex didn't. There is no logical connection that would prevent Chris from finishing the race if Alex didn't.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed the inversion fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
