We are asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we realize that Jen could still watch basketball even if Tom does not watch football. There is no logical connection between Tom's actions and Jen's actions that would prevent this.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" fallacy, we see that the original statement does not logically entail the inverse. The original statement only tells us what happens when Tom watches football, not what happens when he does not.\n\nAnswer: No"
