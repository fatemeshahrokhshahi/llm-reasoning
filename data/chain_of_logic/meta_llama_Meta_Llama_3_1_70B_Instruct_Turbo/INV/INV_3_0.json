We are asked to infer 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the book was written by James' and B = 'the book is a mystery novel'. The inverse of the original statement is 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel', which is (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original statement is (A → B). We are checking if this implies (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide any information about the book's genre when it is not written by James. It only tells us that if James wrote the book, it is a mystery novel.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There is no logical connection that prevents the book from being a mystery novel even if it was not written by James. Many other authors could have written mystery novels.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original statement does not logically entail the inverse, and the inverse is not necessarily true, this is an example of the Inversion Fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
