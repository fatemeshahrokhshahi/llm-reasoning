We are checking if this implies (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional statement does not provide any information about the mummy's state when the vampire is not awake. It only tells us about the mummy's state when the vampire is awake.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the elements, we can see that the mummy's state is not necessarily dependent on the vampire's state. The mummy could still be awake even if the vampire is not awake.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original statement does not logically entail the inverse, and the mummy's state can still be true (awake) even when the vampire's state is false (not awake), this would be an example of the inversion fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
