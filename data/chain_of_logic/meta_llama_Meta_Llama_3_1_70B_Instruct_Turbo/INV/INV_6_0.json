      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'. We are asked to infer 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Sue chose pizza' and B = 'Bob chose pasta'. The inverse of the original statement would be 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta', which is ¬A → ¬B.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original statement is (A → B). We are checking if this implies (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza. It only tells us what happens when she does choose pizza.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Bob could still choose pasta even if Sue does not choose pizza. The original statement does not restrict Bob's choices in any way if Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the Inversion Fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
