      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. We are asked to infer 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Jeff played basketball' and B = 'Amy played tennis'. The inverse of the original statement would be 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', which is ¬A → ¬B.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original statement is (A → B). We are checking if this implies (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide any information about what happens when Jeff does not play basketball. It only tells us what happens when Jeff does play basketball.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the elements, we can see that Amy could still play tennis even if Jeff does not play basketball. The original statement does not restrict Amy's actions when Jeff is not playing basketball.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the Inversion Fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: No"
