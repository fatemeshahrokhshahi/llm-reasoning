We are checking if this implies ¬A → ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide any information about what happens when Ben does not eat pasta. It only tells us what happens when Ben eats pasta.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the elements, we can see that Kate eating salad is not necessarily dependent on Ben eating pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, and the original statement does not exclude those possibilities.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Ben does not eat pasta, and Kate eating salad is not necessarily dependent on Ben eating pasta, we cannot infer the inverse statement. This would be an example of the inversion fallacy.\n\nAnswer: No"
