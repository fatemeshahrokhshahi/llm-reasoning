We are checking if this implies (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. It only tells us that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue is also at the wedding.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - It is possible that Sue could still be at the wedding even if Mary is not. The original statement does not rule out this possibility.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original statement does not logically entail the inverse, and it is possible for Sue to be at the wedding even if Mary is not, we are committing the inversion fallacy if we infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No"
