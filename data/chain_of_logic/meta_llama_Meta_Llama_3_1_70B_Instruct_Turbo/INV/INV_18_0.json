We are asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide any information about the truck's material when the doll is not plastic. It only tells us about the truck's material when the doll is plastic.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the elements, we can see that the truck's material could still be metal even if the doll is not plastic. The original statement does not restrict the truck's material to only being metal when the doll is plastic.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since the original statement does not logically entail the inverse, we have identified the Inversion Fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no"
