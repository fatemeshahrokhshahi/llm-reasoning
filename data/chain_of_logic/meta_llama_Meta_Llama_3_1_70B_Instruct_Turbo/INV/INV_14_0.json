We are asked to infer 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'the bear was in the cave' and B = 'the wolf was in the den'. The inverse of the original statement would be 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den', which is ¬A → ¬B.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original statement is (A → B). We are checking if this implies (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide any information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave. It only tells us about the situation when the bear is in the cave.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the situation, we can see that the wolf's presence in the den is not necessarily dependent on the bear's presence in the cave. The wolf could still be in the den even if the bear is not in the cave.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the Inversion Fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
