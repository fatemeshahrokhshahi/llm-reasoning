The inverse of A is ¬A (the shirt was not cotton), and the inverse of B is ¬B (the pants were not denim).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form of the original statement, we have (A → B). We're asked to infer (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the original conditional proves its inverse, we see that the original statement only tells us about the relationship between A and B, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when A is false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if B could still be true even when A is false, we realize that the pants could still be denim even if the shirt was not cotton. The original statement doesn't rule out this possibility.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed a fallacy to assume that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim, based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
