The original statement only tells us about the relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue, but it does not restrict the truck from being blue in other cases.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Inversion\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed the inversion fallacy, as the original statement does not logically entail its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
