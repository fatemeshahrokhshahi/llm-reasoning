We are asked to infer 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional into elements, we have A = 'Sam took a plane' and B = 'Erin took a train'. The inverse of the original statement would be 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train', which is ¬A → ¬B.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the original statement is (A → B). We are checking if this implies (¬A → ¬B).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The original conditional does not provide any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane. It only tells us what happens when Sam does take a plane.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the elements, we can see that Erin taking a train is not necessarily dependent on Sam taking a plane. Erin could still take a train even if Sam does not take a plane.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the Inversion Fallacy. The original statement does not logically entail its inverse. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the inverse.\n\nAnswer: no"
