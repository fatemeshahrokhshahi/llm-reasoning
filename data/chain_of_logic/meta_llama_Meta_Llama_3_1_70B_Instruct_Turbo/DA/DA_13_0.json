The question is whether we can infer 'The truck was not blue'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The car was red' and B = 'The truck was blue'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A. The question is whether this implies ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (the car was not red), we need to check if we can conclude B is false (the truck was not blue).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the truck's color is not necessarily dependent on the car's color. There could be many other reasons why the truck was blue, regardless of the car's color.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we have identified that B could be true for many other reasons besides A, we conclude that this is an instance of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
