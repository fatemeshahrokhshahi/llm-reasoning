The question is whether we can infer 'The robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The alien visited Mars' and B = 'The robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false, we see that knowing the alien did not visit Mars does not directly tell us anything about the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the robot could have visited Jupiter for many other reasons besides the alien visiting Mars. There could be other factors or events that led to the robot visiting Jupiter.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, we see that it indeed is. The conclusion that the robot did not visit Jupiter is not logically supported by the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
