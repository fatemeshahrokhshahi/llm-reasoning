The question is whether we can infer 'The muffins were not blueberry'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The cake was chocolate' and B = 'The muffins were blueberry'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A. The question is whether this implies ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (the cake was not chocolate), we need to check if we can conclude B is false (the muffins were not blueberry).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the muffins could be blueberry for many reasons besides the cake being chocolate. For example, the muffins could be blueberry because they were made with blueberries, regardless of the cake's flavor.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we have identified that B could be true for many other reasons besides A, we conclude that this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The muffins were not blueberry' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
