The question is whether we can infer 'Erin did not take a train'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Sam took a plane' and B = 'Erin took a train'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false, we see that knowing Sam did not take a plane does not directly tell us anything about Erin's mode of transportation.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Erin could have taken a train for many reasons unrelated to Sam's mode of transportation. For example, Erin might have taken a train because it was her preferred mode of transportation or because it was more convenient for her.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed. The fact that Sam did not take a plane does not imply that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no"
