The question is whether we can infer 'The wolf was not in the den'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The bear was in the cave' and B = 'The wolf was in the den'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false, we see that knowing the bear was not in the cave does not directly tell us anything about the wolf's location.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the wolf could be in the den for many reasons unrelated to the bear's location. For example, the wolf might have gone to the den to rest, to hide from other predators, or to protect its young.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed. The fact that the bear was not in the cave does not imply that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: no"
