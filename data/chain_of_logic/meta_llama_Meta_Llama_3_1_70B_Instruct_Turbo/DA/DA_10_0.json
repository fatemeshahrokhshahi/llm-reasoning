The question is whether we can infer 'The cat was not outside'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The dog was inside' and B = 'The cat was outside'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A. The question is whether this implies ¬B, which is 'The cat was not outside'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (the dog was not inside) does not directly allow us to conclude B is false (the cat was not outside).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There are other ways B could be true without A. For example, the cat could be outside for reasons unrelated to the dog's location. This means that the truth of B is not solely dependent on A.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. The conclusion 'The cat was not outside' does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
