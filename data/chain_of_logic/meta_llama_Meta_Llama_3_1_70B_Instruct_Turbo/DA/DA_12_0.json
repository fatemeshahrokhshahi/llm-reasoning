The question is whether we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Joe went to the park' and B = 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A. The question is whether this implies ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (Joe did not go to the park), we need to check if we can conclude B is false (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Lucy could have gone to the zoo for many other reasons besides Joe going to the park. For example, she might have gone to the zoo with someone else or on her own.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we have identified that B could be true for many other reasons besides A, we conclude that this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
