The question is whether we can infer 'Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Sue chose pizza' and B = 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false, we see that knowing Sue did not choose pizza does not directly tell us about Bob's choice.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Bob could have chosen pasta for many other reasons, such as his personal preference or someone else's suggestion.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed. The fact that Sue did not choose pizza does not imply that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no"
