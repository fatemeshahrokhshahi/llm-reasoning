The question is whether we can infer 'The mummy was not awake'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The vampire was awake' and B = 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false, we see that knowing the vampire was not awake does not directly tell us anything about the mummy's state.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the mummy could be awake for many other reasons besides the vampire being awake. For example, the mummy could be awake due to some other external factor.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, we conclude that it is indeed. The fact that the vampire was not awake does not imply that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
