The shirt was not cotton.\nThe question is whether we can infer that the pants were not denim.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The shirt was cotton.\nB = The pants were denim.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬A ⊢ ¬B?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false:\nIf we know the shirt was not cotton (¬A), can we conclude the pants were not denim (¬B)?\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A:\nThere could be other reasons why the pants were denim, such as the pants being a standard denim style regardless of the shirt material.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" FALLACY:\nThis is indeed the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, as knowing the shirt was not cotton does not necessarily imply the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: No"
