The question is whether we can infer 'Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Jeff played basketball' and B = 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A. The question is whether this implies ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (Jeff did not play basketball), we need to check if we can conclude B is false (Amy did not play tennis).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Amy could have played tennis for many other reasons besides Jeff playing basketball. For example, Amy might have played tennis because she wanted to, or because her friends were playing, or because she had a tennis lesson scheduled.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we have identified that B could be true for many other reasons besides A, we conclude that this is an instance of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Amy did not play tennis' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
