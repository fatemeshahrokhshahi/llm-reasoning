The question is whether we can infer 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The apple was red' and B = 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A. The question is whether this implies ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (the apple was not red), we need to check if we can conclude B is false (the banana was not yellow).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the banana's color is not necessarily dependent on the apple's color. The banana could be yellow for many other reasons, such as its natural color or ripeness.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we have identified that B could be true for many other reasons besides A, we conclude that this is an instance of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
