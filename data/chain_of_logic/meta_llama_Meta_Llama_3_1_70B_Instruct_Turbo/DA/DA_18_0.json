The question is whether we can infer 'The truck was not metal'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The doll was plastic' and B = 'The truck was metal'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A. The question is whether this implies ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (the doll was not plastic), we need to check if we can conclude B is false (the truck was not metal).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the truck could be metal for many reasons other than the doll being plastic. For example, the truck could be metal regardless of the doll's material.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since we have identified that B could be true for many other reasons besides A, we conclude that this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not metal' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
