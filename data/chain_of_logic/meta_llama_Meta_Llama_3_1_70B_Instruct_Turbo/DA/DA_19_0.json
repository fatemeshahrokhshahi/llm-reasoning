The question is whether we can infer 'Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Tom watched football' and B = 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false, we see that knowing Tom did not watch football does not directly tell us anything about Jen's actions.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Jen could have watched basketball for many reasons unrelated to Tom's actions, such as her own interest in basketball or watching it with someone else.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Recognizing that this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, we conclude that we cannot infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
