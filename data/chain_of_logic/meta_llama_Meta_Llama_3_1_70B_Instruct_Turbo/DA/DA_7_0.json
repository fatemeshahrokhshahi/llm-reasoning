The question is whether we can infer 'Chris did not finish the race'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Alex finished the race' and B = 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false, we see that knowing Alex did not finish the race does not directly tell us anything about Chris finishing the race.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that Chris could have finished the race for many other reasons besides Alex finishing the race. For example, Chris could have finished the race independently of Alex's performance.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, we see that it is indeed the case. We are trying to conclude that Chris did not finish the race solely based on the fact that Alex did not finish the race, which is an invalid logical conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
