The question is whether we can infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The griffin was in the forest' and B = 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false, we see that knowing the griffin was not in the forest does not directly tell us anything about the unicorn's presence.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the unicorn could be in the forest for many other reasons besides the griffin's presence. The unicorn's presence is not dependent solely on the griffin.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this is the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy, we see that it is indeed. The conclusion that the unicorn was not in the forest is not logically supported by the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
