The question is whether we can infer 'The book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The book was written by James' and B = 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - The logical form of the given statements is (A → B) ∧ ¬A.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are checking if knowing A is false allows us to conclude B is false. However, we must proceed with caution as this resembles the denying the antecedent fallacy.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing if there are other ways B could be true without A, we realize that the book could be a mystery novel even if it was not written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the analysis, we conclude that this is indeed the denying the antecedent fallacy. The truth of B does not depend solely on A, and there are other possible reasons for B to be true.\n\nAnswer: No"
