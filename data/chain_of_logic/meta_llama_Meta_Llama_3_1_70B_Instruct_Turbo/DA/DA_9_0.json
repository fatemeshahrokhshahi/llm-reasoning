The question is whether we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B = 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬A. The question is whether this implies ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Knowing A is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) does not directly allow us to conclude B is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, such as he liked the color or it was on sale. The fact that Lisa did not buy the red shirt does not provide any information about Mark's decision to buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - This is an example of the \"Denying the Antecedent\" fallacy. The conclusion that Mark did not buy the blue shirt is not logically justified.\n\nAnswer: no"
