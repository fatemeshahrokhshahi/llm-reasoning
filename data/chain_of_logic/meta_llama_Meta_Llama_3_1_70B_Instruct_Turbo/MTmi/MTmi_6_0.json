      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a conditional statement with a modal \"must\" and a modal possibility \"might not\". The conditional statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" (p → □q), and the modal possibility is \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" (♢¬q).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p (Sue chose pizza), □q (Bob must have chosen pasta), and ♢¬q (Bob might not have chosen pasta).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we need to determine if it entails ¬p (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We test if the modal possibility \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" contradicts the modal necessity \"Bob must have chosen pasta\". However, \"might not\" expresses possibility, not definitive negation.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We distinguish \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts. \"Might not\" does not imply a definitive negation, whereas \"not\" would.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the critical rule that Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is invalid, we cannot infer ¬p (Sue did not choose pizza) from (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q.\n\nAnswer: no"
