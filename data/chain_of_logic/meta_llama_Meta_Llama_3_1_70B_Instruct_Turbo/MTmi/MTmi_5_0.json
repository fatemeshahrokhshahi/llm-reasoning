      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a conditional statement with a modal \"must\" and a modal possibility \"might not\". The conditional statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" (p → □q), and the modal possibility is \"Amy might not have played tennis\" (♢¬q).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p (Jeff played basketball), □q (Amy must have played tennis), and ♢¬q (Amy might not have played tennis).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we need to determine if it entails ¬p (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We test if the modal possibility \"Amy might not have played tennis\" contradicts the modal necessity \"Amy must have played tennis\". However, \"might not\" expresses possibility, not definitive negation.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We distinguish \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts. \"Might not\" does not provide a definitive negation, whereas \"not\" would be required for a valid Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the critical rule that Modal Modus Tollens with \"might\" is invalid, we conclude that the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
