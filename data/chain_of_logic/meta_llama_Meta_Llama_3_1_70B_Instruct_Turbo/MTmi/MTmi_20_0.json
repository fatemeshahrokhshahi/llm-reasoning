This means that 'The banana might not have been yellow' does not necessarily mean 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Distinguishing \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts, we understand that 'might not' is not the same as 'not'. This distinction is crucial in modal logic.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the CRITICAL RULE that Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is invalid, we conclude that the given premises do not logically entail the conclusion 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: no"
