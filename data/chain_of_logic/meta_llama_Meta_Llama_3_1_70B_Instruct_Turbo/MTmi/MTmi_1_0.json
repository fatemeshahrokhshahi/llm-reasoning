      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" which can be represented as p → □q, where p is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and □q is \"Sue must have been at the wedding\". We also have the statement \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" which can be represented as ♢¬q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p → □q and ♢¬q. \n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we need to determine if it entails ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We need to test if the modal possibility \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" contradicts the modal necessity \"Sue must have been at the wedding\". However, \"might not\" expresses possibility, not definitive negation.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - It's crucial to distinguish \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts. \"Might not\" does not imply a definitive negation, but rather a possibility of negation.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the critical rule that Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is invalid, we cannot infer ¬p from (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q.\n\nAnswer: no"
