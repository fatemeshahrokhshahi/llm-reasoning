      "content": "Explanation: \nWe are given a conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' which can be represented as p → □q, where p is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and □q is 'Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. We are also given the statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt', which can be represented as ♢¬q.\n\nBreaking down the components, we have p → □q and ♢¬q. Analyzing the logical expression (p → □q) ∧ ♢¬q, we need to determine if it entails ¬p.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious when dealing with modal possibility. The statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' expresses possibility, not definitive negation. This is crucial in distinguishing \"might not\" from \"not\" in modal contexts.\n\nApplying the critical rule, we know that Modal Modus Tollens with 'might' is invalid. This means that even though we have a conditional statement with a modal necessity (p → □q) and a modal possibility that seems to contradict it (♢¬q), we cannot infer ¬p.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
