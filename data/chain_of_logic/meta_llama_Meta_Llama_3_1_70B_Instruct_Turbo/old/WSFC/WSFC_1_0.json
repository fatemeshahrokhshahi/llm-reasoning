      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The original modal statement is 'John might clean his room or he might go to the lecture', which can be represented as ♢p ∨ ♢q, where p is 'John cleans his room' and q is 'John goes to the lecture'. The proposed inference is 'John might clean his room and he might go to the lecture', represented as ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have ♢p ∨ ♢q (John might clean his room or he might go to the lecture) and ♢p ∧ ♢q (John might clean his room and he might go to the lecture).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the relationship between ♢p ∨ ♢q and ♢p ∧ ♢q, we need to determine if the disjunction of possibilities implies the conjunction of possibilities.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if wide-scope free choice is valid, we examine if 'John might clean his room or he might go to the lecture' necessarily implies 'John might clean his room and he might go to the lecture'.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Considering the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we note that in standard modal logic, ♢p ∨ ♢q does not generally imply ♢p ∧ ♢q. This is because disjunctive possibilities and conjunctive possibilities have different truth conditions.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we conclude that the Wide-Scope Free Choice inference is not valid in standard modal logic.\n\nAnswer: no"
