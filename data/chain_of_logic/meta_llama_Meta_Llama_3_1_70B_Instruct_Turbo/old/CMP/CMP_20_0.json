  "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The problem presents a nested conditional structure and probability claims. The claims are: \n- Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers.\n- Tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n- If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the elements:\n- Probabilities: Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, tea is less likely, and soda is the least likely.\n- Nested conditionals: If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n- The question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the nested conditional: If p → (q → r) and p is likely, does q → r become likely? In this case, p is \"tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers,\" q is \"coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers,\" and r is \"soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\"\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals. The critical issue here is whether the likelihood of coffee retaining the most morning drinkers affects the likelihood of the conditional \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\"\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario. The problem is that the nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem. Even if coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, the conditional \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers\" involves low-probability outcomes.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid. According to the CRITICAL RULE, Complex Modus Ponens with probabilities is often invalid. In this case, the inference breaks down because the nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem.\n\nAnswer: No"
