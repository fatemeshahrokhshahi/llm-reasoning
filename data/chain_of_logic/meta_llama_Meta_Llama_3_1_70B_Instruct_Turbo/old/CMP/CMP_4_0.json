  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The problem presents a nested conditional structure and probability claims. The hiring manager thinks it's most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. The conditionals are: if Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the elements, we have: \n- p: Priya gets the offer (likely)\n- q: Julian gets the offer (less likely than p)\n- r: Diego gets the offer (unlikely)\n- The nested conditional: if q doesn't happen, then if p doesn't happen, r will happen\n- The question: Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will?\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression, we have: if p → (q → r) and p is likely, does q → r become likely? In this case, the nested conditional is if q doesn't happen, then if p doesn't happen, r will happen.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if likelihood transfers through nested conditionals, we see that the likelihood of p (Priya getting the offer) does not directly transfer to the likelihood of q → r (if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Analyzing the probability distribution in the conditional scenario, we see that the nested conditional creates a probability distribution problem. The likelihood of Diego getting the offer (r) is low, and the conditionals do not change this probability.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Complex Modus Ponens inference is valid, we see that it is not. The CRITICAL RULE states that Complex Modus Ponens with probabilities is often invalid, especially when the nested conditional involves low-probability outcomes.\n\nAnswer: No"
