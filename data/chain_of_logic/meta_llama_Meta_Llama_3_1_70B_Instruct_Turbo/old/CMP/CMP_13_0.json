  "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

      "content": "Explanation: \n\nStep 1: Structured Input - The problem presents a nested conditional structure: \"if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.\" It also provides probability claims: Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the elements, we have: \n- p: Tennessee likely will add the most jobs\n- q: Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs\n- r: Missouri will add the most jobs\n- The nested conditional: q → (¬p → r)\n- The question: Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will? (i.e., is ¬p → r likely?)\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the nested conditional, we see that if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs (q), then if Tennessee doesn’t (¬p), Missouri will (r). However, we also know that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs (p), which makes Georgia not adding the most jobs (q) more likely.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - The question is whether the likelihood of Missouri adding the most jobs (r) transfers through the nested conditional when Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs (¬p). However, we must consider the probability distribution in the conditional scenario.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - CRITICAL: Analyzing the probability distribution, we see that while Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, the conditional scenario where Tennessee doesn’t (¬p) is less likely. In this less likely scenario, the probability of Missouri adding the most jobs (r) is still low, as Missouri's growth is significantly lower than the other two states.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the low probability of Missouri adding the most jobs (r) in the conditional scenario where Tennessee doesn’t (¬p), we cannot conclude that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will. This is an example of Complex Modus Ponens with probabilities being invalid.\n\nAnswer: No"
