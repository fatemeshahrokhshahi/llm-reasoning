      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and the consequent affirmation is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. \n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'Joe went to the park' (p) and 'Lucy went to the zoo' (q). The statement can be represented as (p → q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statements, we have (p → q) ∧ q. We need to determine if this expression entails p, which is 'Joe went to the park'.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case. However, according to the critical rule, affirming the consequent is invalid.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - We must consider the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. It does not guarantee that Joe went to the park if Lucy went to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, we conclude that affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Joe went to the park' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
