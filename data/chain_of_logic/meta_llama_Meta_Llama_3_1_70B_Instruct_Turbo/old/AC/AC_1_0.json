      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' and the consequent affirmation is 'Sue was at the wedding'. \n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'Mary was at the wedding' (p) and 'Sue was at the wedding' (q). The statement can be represented as (p → q).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the given statements, we have (p → q) ∧ q. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid, i.e., if (p → q) ∧ q ⊢ p.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the directional nature of conditionals, we see that 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' only guarantees that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue was also at the wedding. However, it does not guarantee that if Sue was at the wedding, Mary was also at the wedding. There could be alternative causes for Sue being at the wedding.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the analysis, affirming the consequent in this case is invalid. The presence of Sue at the wedding does not necessarily imply that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
