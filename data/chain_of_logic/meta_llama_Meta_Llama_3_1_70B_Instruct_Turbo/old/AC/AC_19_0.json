      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - The conditional statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' and the consequent affirmation is 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional statement, we have 'Tom watched football' (p) and 'Jen watched basketball' (q). \n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression (p → q) ∧ q, we need to determine if it entails p. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if affirming the consequent is valid in this case. \n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - It is crucial to examine the directional nature of conditionals and alternative causes. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, it does not rule out other possibilities that could lead to Jen watching basketball. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that affirming the consequent is invalid, we cannot infer that Tom watched football solely from the given information. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: No"
