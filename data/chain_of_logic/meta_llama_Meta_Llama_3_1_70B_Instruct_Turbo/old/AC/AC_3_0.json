The conditional statement only guarantees that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, but it does not rule out other authors writing mystery novels. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that affirming the consequent is invalid, we cannot infer that the book was written by James solely because it is a mystery novel. There could be multiple authors who write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no"
