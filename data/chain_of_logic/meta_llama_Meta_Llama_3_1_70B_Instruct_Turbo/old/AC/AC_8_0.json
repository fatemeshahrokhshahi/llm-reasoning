The conditional statement only guarantees that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not rule out other possibilities that could cause the mummy to be awake. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the fundamental logical fallacy of affirming the consequent, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake solely based on the given information. There could be other reasons why the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
