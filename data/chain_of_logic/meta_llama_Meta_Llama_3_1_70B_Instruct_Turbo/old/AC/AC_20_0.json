The fact that the banana was yellow does not necessarily mean the apple was red, as there could be multiple causes for the banana being yellow. \n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the directional nature of conditionals and the possibility of alternative causes, we cannot infer that the apple was red solely based on the banana being yellow.\n\nAnswer: no"
