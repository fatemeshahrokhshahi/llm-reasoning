      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a conditional statement with a modal \"must\" and the negation of necessity: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\" and \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p → □q, where p is \"the alien visited Mars\" and □q is \"the robot must have visited Jupiter\". We also have ¬□q, which is \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it logically entails ¬p, which is \"The alien did not visit Mars\".\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\" contradicts \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of the necessity (\"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\") directly contradicts the conditional statement with the modal \"must\".\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the CRITICAL RULE that Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid, we can conclude that the given statements logically entail the negation of the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
