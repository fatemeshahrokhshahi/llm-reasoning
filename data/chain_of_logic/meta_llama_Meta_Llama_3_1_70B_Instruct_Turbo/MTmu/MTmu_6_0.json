      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a conditional statement with a modal \"must\" and the negation of necessity: 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta' (p → □q) and 'It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta' (¬□q).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p (Sue chose pizza) and □q (Bob must have chosen pasta). The negation of necessity is ¬□q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it logically entails ¬p (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We test if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negation of necessity (¬□q) contradicts the conditional statement (p → □q), which suggests that modus tollens is applicable.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the modal \"must\" is within the scope of the conditional statement. This is a classic case of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - According to the CRITICAL RULE, Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
