In this case, the negation of necessity (¬□q) contradicts the necessity implied by the conditional (p → □q).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity (¬□q) directly contradicts the necessity (□q) implied by the conditional. This is a classic case of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - According to the CRITICAL RULE, Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid. Therefore, the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q logically entails ¬p.\n\nAnswer: yes"
