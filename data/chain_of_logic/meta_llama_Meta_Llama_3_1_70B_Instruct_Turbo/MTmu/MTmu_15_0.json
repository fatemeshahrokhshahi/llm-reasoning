In this case, the negation of necessity (¬□q) contradicts the necessity (□q) in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity (¬□q) directly contradicts the necessity (□q) in the conditional statement, which is a key component of the Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the CRITICAL RULE that Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid, we can conclude that the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q logically entails ¬p.\n\nAnswer: yes"
