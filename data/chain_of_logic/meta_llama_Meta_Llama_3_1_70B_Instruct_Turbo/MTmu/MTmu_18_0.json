      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a conditional statement with a modal \"must\" and the negation of necessity: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal' (p → □q) and 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal' (¬□q).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p (the doll was plastic), □q (the truck must have been metal), and ¬□q (it's not the case that the truck must have been metal).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it logically entails ¬p (the doll was not plastic).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We test if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, the negation of necessity (¬□q) contradicts the conditional statement (p → □q), which suggests that modus tollens may be applicable.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the modal \"must\" is within the scope of the conditional statement. This is crucial for applying modal modus tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the critical rule that modal modus tollens with 'must' is valid, we can conclude that the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q logically entails ¬p.\n\nAnswer: yes"
