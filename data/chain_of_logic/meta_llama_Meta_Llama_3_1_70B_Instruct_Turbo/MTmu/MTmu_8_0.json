In this case, \"not necessarily q\" (¬□q) contradicts \"if p then necessarily q\" (p → □q), which is a characteristic of modal modus tollens.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of the necessity of q (¬□q) directly contradicts the conditional statement that p implies the necessity of q (p → □q). This is a valid application of modal modus tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that modal modus tollens with \"must\" is valid, we can conclude that the given premises logically entail the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
