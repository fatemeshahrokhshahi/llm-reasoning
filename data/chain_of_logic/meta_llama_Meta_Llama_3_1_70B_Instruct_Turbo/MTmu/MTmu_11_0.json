The negation of necessity is ¬□q, which is \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it entails ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" contradicts \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity (¬□q) directly contradicts the necessity (□q) in the conditional statement.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - According to the CRITICAL RULE, Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid. Therefore, we can infer that if the conditional statement is true and the negation of necessity is true, then the antecedent (p) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
