In this case, \"not necessarily blue\" contradicts \"if the car was red, then necessarily blue\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of the necessity (\"not necessarily blue\") directly contradicts the conditional statement (\"if the car was red, then necessarily blue\").\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the CRITICAL RULE that Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid, we can conclude that the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q ⊢ ¬p is indeed valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
