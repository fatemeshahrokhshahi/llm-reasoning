In this case, \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race\" contradicts \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity (¬□q) directly contradicts the necessity (□q) in the conditional statement. This is a classic case of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid, we can conclude that the given premises entail the negation of the antecedent (Alex did not finish the race).\n\nAnswer: yes"
