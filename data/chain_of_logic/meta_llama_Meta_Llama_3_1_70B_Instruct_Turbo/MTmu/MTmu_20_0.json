The negation of necessity is ¬□q, which is \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it implies ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" contradicts \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the modal \"must\" is within the scope of the conditional. The critical rule states that Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule, we can conclude that (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q ⊢ ¬p is valid. Therefore, we can infer that \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
