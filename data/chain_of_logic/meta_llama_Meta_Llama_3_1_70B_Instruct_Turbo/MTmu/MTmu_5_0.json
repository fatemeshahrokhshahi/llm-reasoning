      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a conditional statement with a modal \"must\" and the negation of necessity: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" (p → □q) and \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" (¬□q).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p (Jeff played basketball) and □q (Amy must have played tennis). The negation of necessity is ¬□q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it entails ¬p (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, \"not necessarily q\" (Amy didn't necessarily play tennis) contradicts \"if p then necessarily q\" (if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of necessity (¬□q) directly contradicts the modal \"must\" in the conditional statement (p → □q). This is a classic case of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Since Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid, we can conclude that the given statements entail the negation of p.\n\nAnswer: yes"
