According to the CRITICAL RULE, Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that \"not necessarily q\" (¬□q) contradicts \"if p then necessarily q\" (p → □q), which supports the validity of Modal Modus Tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the CRITICAL RULE, we determine that this Modal Modus Tollens is valid, and therefore, we can infer ¬p (the griffin was not in the forest) from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
