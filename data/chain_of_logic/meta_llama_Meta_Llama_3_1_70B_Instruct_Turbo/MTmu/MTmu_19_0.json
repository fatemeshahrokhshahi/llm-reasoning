      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have a conditional statement with a modal \"must\" and the negation of necessity: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" (p → □q) and \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\" (¬□q).\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p (Tom watched football), □q (Jen must have watched basketball), and ¬□q (It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball).\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it logically entails ¬p (Tom did not watch football).\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We test if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\" contradicts \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the negation of the necessity (¬□q) directly contradicts the conditional statement (p → □q), which is a characteristic of modus tollens.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given that Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid, we can conclude that the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q logically entails ¬p.\n\nAnswer: yes"
