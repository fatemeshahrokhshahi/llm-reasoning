      "content": "Explanation: \nStep 1: Structured Input - We have identified the conditional with modal \"must\" as \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" and the negation of necessity as \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the components, we have p → □q, where p is \"Joe went to the park\" and □q is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". The negation of necessity is ¬□q, which is \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the expression (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q, we need to determine if it logically entails ¬p.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are testing if the negated modal necessity supports modus tollens. In this case, \"not necessarily q\" (Lucy didn't necessarily go to the zoo) contradicts \"if p then necessarily q\" (if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the modal scope and logical relationships, we see that the modal \"must\" is within the scope of the conditional. This means that the necessity of Lucy going to the zoo is dependent on Joe going to the park.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Given the CRITICAL RULE that Modal Modus Tollens with 'must' is valid, we can conclude that (p → □q) ∧ ¬□q ⊢ ¬p is indeed valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
