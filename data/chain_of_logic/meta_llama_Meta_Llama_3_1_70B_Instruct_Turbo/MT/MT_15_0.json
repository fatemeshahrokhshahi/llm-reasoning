Erin did not take a train.\nThe question is whether we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = Sam took a plane\nB = Erin took a train\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nWe know that Erin did not take a train, which means ¬B is true.\nThe conditional rule tells us that if Sam took a plane (A), then Erin took a train (B). However, since Erin did not take a train (¬B), we can use this information to make an inference about Sam.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nGiven the conditional rule and the fact that Erin did not take a train, we can apply the Modus Tollens rule to make an inference about Sam.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule to reach a conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Tollens rule, (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A, we can conclude that if Erin did not take a train (¬B), then Sam did not take a plane (¬A).\n\nAnswer: yes"
