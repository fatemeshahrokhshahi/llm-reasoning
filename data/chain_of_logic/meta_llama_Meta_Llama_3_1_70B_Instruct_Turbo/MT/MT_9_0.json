Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\nThe question is whether we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = Lisa bought the red shirt\nB = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nWe know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, which means ¬B is true.\nThe conditional tells us that if A (Lisa bought the red shirt), then B (Mark bought the blue shirt). However, since we know that B is false, we can use this information to make an inference about A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince we have a conditional rule (A → B) and we know that ¬B is true, we can apply the Modus Tollens rule to make an inference about A.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule to reach a conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
