The question is whether we can infer 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Alex finished the race' and B = 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B ('Chris finished the race') is false, as stated in the second premise ('Chris did not finish the race'). According to the conditional rule, if A ('Alex finished the race') is true, then B ('Chris finished the race') must also be true. However, since B is false, we can infer something about A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we see that the conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. But since B is false, A cannot be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
