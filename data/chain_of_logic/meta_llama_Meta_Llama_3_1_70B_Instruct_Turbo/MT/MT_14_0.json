The wolf was not in the den.\nThe question is whether we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The bear was in the cave.\nB = The wolf was in the den.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nWe are given that the wolf was not in the den, which means ¬B is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nGiven the conditional rule (A → B) and the fact that ¬B is true, we can apply the Modus Tollens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule to reach a conclusion:\nAccording to the Modus Tollens rule, (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
