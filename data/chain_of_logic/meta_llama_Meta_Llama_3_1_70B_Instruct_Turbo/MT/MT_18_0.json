The question is whether we can infer 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have:\n- A: The doll was plastic\n- B: The truck was metal\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B (The truck was metal) is false, as stated in the second premise 'The truck was not metal'. According to the conditional rule, if A (The doll was plastic), then B (The truck was metal). However, since B is false, we need to determine what this tells us about A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we see that the conditional rule 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and the fact that 'The truck was not metal' lead us to question the truth of A (The doll was plastic).\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, which states that (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A, we can conclude that if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
