The cat was not outside (fact).\nThe question is whether we can infer 'The dog was inside'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The dog was inside\nB = The cat was outside\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ?\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nWe are given that the cat was not outside (¬B). According to the conditional rule, if the dog was inside (A), then the cat was outside (B). However, we know that the cat was not outside (¬B).\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince we have ¬B, we can use the conditional rule to infer something about A. However, the conditional rule only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not tell us that if B is false, then A must be false. But we are trying to infer A from ¬B, which is not directly supported by the conditional rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule:\nThe Modus Tollens rule states that (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A. However, in this case, we are trying to infer A, not ¬A. The correct application of the Modus Tollens rule would be to infer that the dog was not inside (¬A), not that the dog was inside (A).\n\nAnswer: no"
