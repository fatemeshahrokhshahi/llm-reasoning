The question is whether we can infer 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The griffin was in the forest' and B = 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B ('The unicorn was in the forest') is false, as stated in the second premise ('The unicorn was not in the forest'). According to the conditional rule, if A ('The griffin was in the forest') were true, then B ('The unicorn was in the forest') would also be true. However, since B is false, we need to evaluate what this tells us about A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we see that the conditional rule and the falsity of B imply that A cannot be true. This is because if A were true, B would also be true, but we know B is false.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we conclude that since (A → B) and ¬B, then ¬A.\n\nAnswer: yes"
