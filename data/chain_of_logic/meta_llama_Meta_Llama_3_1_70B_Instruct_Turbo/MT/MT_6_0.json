Bob did not choose pasta.\nThe question is whether we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = Sue chose pizza\nB = Bob chose pasta\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false: \nWe are given that Bob did not choose pasta, which means ¬B is true. \nThe conditional tells us that if Sue chose pizza (A), then Bob chose pasta (B). \nHowever, we know that Bob did not choose pasta (¬B), so we need to evaluate what this tells us about Sue's choice.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nGiven the conditional rule (A → B) and the fact that ¬B is true, we can apply the Modus Tollens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule to reach a conclusion:\nSince (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A is a valid logical expression, we can conclude that if Bob did not choose pasta (¬B), then Sue did not choose pizza (¬A).\n\nAnswer: yes"
