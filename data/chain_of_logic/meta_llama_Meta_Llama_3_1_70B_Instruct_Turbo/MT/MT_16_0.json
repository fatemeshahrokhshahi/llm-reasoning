The pants were not denim.\nThe question is whether we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The shirt was cotton\nB = The pants were denim\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nWe are given that the pants were not denim, which means ¬B is true. \nThe conditional rule tells us that if the shirt was cotton (A), then the pants were denim (B). \nSince we know the pants were not denim (¬B), we can use this information to evaluate the logic.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nWe have a conditional rule (A → B) and we know that ¬B is true. \nAccording to the rule, if A were true, then B would be true. \nHowever, we know that B is not true (¬B). \nThis means that A cannot be true, because if A were true, it would lead to a contradiction with the known fact that B is not true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule to reach conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. \nIn this case, A = The shirt was cotton, and B = The pants were denim. \nSince we know that the pants were not denim (¬B), we can infer that the shirt was not cotton (¬A).\n\nAnswer: yes"
