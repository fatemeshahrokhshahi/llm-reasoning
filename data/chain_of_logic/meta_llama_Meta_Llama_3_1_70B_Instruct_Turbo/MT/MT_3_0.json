The book is not a mystery novel.\nThe question is: Can we infer that the book was not written by James?\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The book was written by James.\nB = The book is a mystery novel.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nFrom the second premise, we know that B (the book is a mystery novel) is false. \nThe conditional rule tells us that if A (the book was written by James) is true, then B (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. However, we know that B is false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince B is false, and the conditional rule states that A implies B, we can conclude that A cannot be true. If A were true, then B would also be true, which contradicts the given information.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule to reach conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A implies B and B is false, then A must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
