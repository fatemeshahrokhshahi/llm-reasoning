The mummy was not awake (fact).\nThe question is whether we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The vampire was awake\nB = The mummy was awake\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nWe know that the mummy was not awake, which means ¬B is true. \nThe conditional rule tells us that if A (the vampire was awake), then B (the mummy was awake) must be true. However, we know that B is false.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince the mummy was not awake (¬B), and the conditional rule states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, we can conclude that the vampire being awake would lead to a contradiction (the mummy being awake, which is not the case).\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying Modus Tollens rule to reach conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Tollens rule, we can infer that if the mummy was not awake (¬B), and the conditional rule is true, then the vampire was not awake (¬A).\n\nAnswer: yes"
