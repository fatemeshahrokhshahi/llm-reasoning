The robot did not visit Jupiter (fact).\nThe question is whether we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The alien visited Mars\nB = The robot visited Jupiter\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nFrom the given fact, we know that B (the robot visited Jupiter) is false, i.e., ¬B.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nGiven the conditional rule (A → B) and the fact that B is false (¬B), we can apply the Modus Tollens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule to reach a conclusion:\nSince (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A is a valid logical expression, we can conclude that if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
