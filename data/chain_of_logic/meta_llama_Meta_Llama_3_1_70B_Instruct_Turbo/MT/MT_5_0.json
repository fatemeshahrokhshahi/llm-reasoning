Amy did not play tennis.\nThe question is: Can we infer 'Jeff did not play basketball'?\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = Jeff played basketball\nB = Amy played tennis\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nFrom the second premise, we know that Amy did not play tennis, which means ¬B is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nGiven the conditional rule (A → B) and the fact that ¬B is true, we can apply the Modus Tollens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule to reach a conclusion:\nSince (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A is a valid logical expression, we can conclude that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
