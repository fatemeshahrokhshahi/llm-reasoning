The truck was not blue.\nThe question is whether we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = The car was red\nB = The truck was blue\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nFrom the second premise, we know that the truck was not blue, which means ¬B is true.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nGiven the conditional rule (A → B) and the fact that ¬B is true, we can apply the Modus Tollens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule to reach a conclusion:\nSince (A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A is a valid logical expression, we can conclude that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, and the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
