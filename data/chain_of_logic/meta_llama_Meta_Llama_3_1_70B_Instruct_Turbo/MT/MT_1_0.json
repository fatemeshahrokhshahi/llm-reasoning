The question is whether we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'Mary was at the wedding' and B = 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B ('Sue was at the wedding') is false, as indicated by 'Sue was not at the wedding'. According to the conditional rule, if A ('Mary was at the wedding') is true, then B ('Sue was at the wedding') must also be true. However, since B is false, we can infer something about A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we see that the conditional rule tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. But since B is false, A cannot be true.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
