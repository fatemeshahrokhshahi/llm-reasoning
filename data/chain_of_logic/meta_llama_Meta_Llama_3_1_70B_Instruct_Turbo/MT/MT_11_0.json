The question is whether we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements, we have A = 'The cake was chocolate' and B = 'The muffins were blueberry'.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form, we have (A → B) ∧ ¬B.\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - We are given that the consequent B ('The muffins were blueberry') is false, as stated in the second premise ('The muffins were not blueberry'). According to the conditional rule, if A ('The cake was chocolate'), then B ('The muffins were blueberry'). Since B is false, we need to determine what this tells us about A.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers, we know that if A, then B, but B is false. This situation matches the Modus Tollens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
