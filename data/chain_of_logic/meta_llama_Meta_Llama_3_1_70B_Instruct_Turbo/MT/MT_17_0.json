Kate did not eat the salad.\nThe question is whether we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nStep 2: Rule Decomposition - Breaking down the conditional rule into elements:\nA = Ben ate pasta\nB = Kate ate the salad\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Writing the logical form:\n(A → B) ∧ ¬B ⊢ ¬A\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Checking if the consequent B is false:\nWe are given that Kate did not eat the salad, which means B is false (¬B).\nThe conditional tells us that if Ben ate pasta (A), then Kate ate the salad (B). However, since we know Kate did not eat the salad (¬B), we can use this information to infer something about Ben eating pasta.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Combining the answers to evaluate the logic:\nSince we have a conditional rule (A → B) and we know that B is false (¬B), we can apply the Modus Tollens rule.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Applying the Modus Tollens rule to reach a conclusion:\nUsing the Modus Tollens rule, we can conclude that if A → B and ¬B, then ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"
