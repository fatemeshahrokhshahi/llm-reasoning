The proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression, we need to determine if ♢(p ∨ q) ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q. In natural language, \"Might (A or B)\" often implies \"Might A and might B\".\n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if narrow-scope free choice is valid, we consider if the original statement genuinely implies both options are available.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we see that the original statement \"The team might win or lose the match\" indeed suggests that both winning and losing are possible outcomes.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Determining if this Narrow-Scope Free Choice inference is valid, we conclude that the original statement supports the proposed inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
