The proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression, we need to determine if ♢(p ∨ q) ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if narrow-scope free choice is valid, we consider if \"The project might be completed early or late\" implies both options are genuinely available.\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we note that in natural language, \"Might (A or B)\" often implies \"Might A and might B\". This is a case of narrow-scope free choice.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule that narrow-scope free choice is valid in natural language, we can conclude that the proposed inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
