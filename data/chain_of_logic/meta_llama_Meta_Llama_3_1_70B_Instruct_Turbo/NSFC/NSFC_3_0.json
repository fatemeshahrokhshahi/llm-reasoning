The proposed inference is ♢p ∧ ♢q.\n\nStep 3: Logical Expression - Analyzing the logical expression, we need to determine if ♢(p ∨ q) ⊢ ♢p ∧ ♢q. \n\nStep 4: Question Answering - Testing if narrow-scope free choice is valid, we consider the natural language interpretation of \"might (A or B)\" implying \"might A and might B\".\n\nStep 5: Element Recomposition - Examining the scope of modal operators and free choice reasoning, we note that the critical rule of narrow-scope free choice being valid in natural language applies here.\n\nStep 6: Resolve Expression - Based on the critical rule, we determine that the narrow-scope free choice inference is valid in this case.\n\nAnswer: yes"
